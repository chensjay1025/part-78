(from IMDB)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0018876/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0018876/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSpanish, Chinese, and Japanese, subtitles included, DVD cover says special edition probably because of the former. There are no other extras.\n\nThis is a silent film and one of the only Hitchcock films where he doesn't do a cameo.\n\nSlow to start but some HILARIOUS moments, this is Hitchcock at his very beginning.\n\nOne or two of the early text cells are faded but not my fault, this is the only DVD release of this film I could find and it doesn't affect the story.  If you pause it you can make them out.\n\nBeen looking for this for a while. Couldn't find a healthy torrent. Thought I'd share. \n\nPlease seed. If not healthy, request by comment, I check every few weeks. I'll reseed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:112e549ad2198e1de73ccf6581aa5b7c595e87fa","amp;dn":"The+Farmer%5C%27s+Wife+1928+.iso+Hitchcock","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"112e549ad2198e1de73ccf6581aa5b7c595e87fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,46,84,154,210,25,142,29,231,60,207,101,129,170,91,124,89,94,135,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
