Silver Flame \n 2. Mistress Of The Dark \n 3. Serpents Fire \n 4. Shine \n 5. Blue \n 6. Play \n 7. Nightmare \n 8. Black Void Nirvana \n 9. Hearts Blood \n 10. Night Reborn \n\n\n\n\nReview from Gryphon-metal\n\n\nWhat would happen if the Sisters Of Mercy, Type O Negative, and The Cure were at a funeral, and decided to collaborate on an album?  Tenebre.\n\nLike Type O Negative, Tenebre has been moving from a metal band, to gothic rock with stunning results.\n\nTenebre's latest album &quot;Hearts Blood&quot;  has a real old school gothic rock feel. Plenty of mood to induce\na melancholy trance.\n\nThe gothic groove they are producing is infectious. With songs like &quot;Blue&quot; which would definately be played with a broken heart and one to many glasses of merlot.\nWhile &quot;Black Void Nirvana&quot; with it's slow and desolate sound, nutures the emptiness inside us.\n&quot;Serpent's Fire&quot; Has a strange &quot;The Cure&quot; quality to the guitar parts which sets it off.\n&quot;Mistress of the Dark&quot; captures the elements of classic gothic rock splendidly.\n\nIf you like Gothic Rock, this album should definately be checked out. If you do not listen to gothic rock, this album would be a good place to start.\n\n\n\nThe break down...:\n \nRecorded and mixed well, The sound is Dark and Desolate. Definately check this one out.\n\n\n\nrating: 8.5/10\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e7e784de17bee3799cb354382817428285ec728","amp;dn":"Tenebre+-+Heart%5C%27s+Blood","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e7e784de17bee3799cb354382817428285ec728","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,126,120,77,225,123,238,55,153,203,53,67,130,129,116,40,40,94,199,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
