The film is set in the year 2154, when humans are mining a precious mineral called unobtanium on Pandora, a lush moon of a gas giant in the Alpha Centauri star system.[7][8][9] The expansion of the mining colony threatens the continued existence of a local tribe of Na'viÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a sentient humanoid species indigenous to Pandora. The film's title refers to the genetically engineered Na'vi-human hybrid bodies used by a team of researchers to interact with the natives of Pandora.[10]\n\nDevelopment on Avatar began in 1994, when Cameron wrote an 80-page scriptment for the film.[11] Filming was supposed to take place after the completion of Cameron's 1997 film Titanic, for a planned release in 1999,[12] but according to Cameron, the necessary technology was not yet available to achieve his vision of the film.[13] Work on the language for the film's extraterrestrial beings began in summer 2005, and Cameron began developing the screenplay and fictional universe in early 2006.[14][15]\n\nAvatar was officially budgeted at $237 million.[2] Other estimates put the cost between $280 million and $310 million for production, and at $150 million for promotion.[16][17][18] The film was released for traditional two-dimensional projectors, as well as in 3D, using the RealD 3D, Dolby 3D, XpanD 3D and IMAX 3D formats, and also in 4D.[19] The stereoscopic filmmaking was touted as a likely breakthrough in cinematic technology.[20]\n\nAvatar premiered in London on December 10, 2009, and was released overseas on December 16 and in North America on December 18, to critical acclaim and commercial success.[21][22][23] The film broke several box office records during its release and became the highest-grossing film of all time in North America[24] and worldwide, surpassing Titanic, which had held the records for the previous 12 years.[25] It also became the first film to gross more than $2 billion,[26] as well as the highest-grossing 3-D movie of all time. Following the film's success, Cameron stated that there will be a sequel.[27] Avatar was nominated for nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director,[28] and won three, for Best Cinematography, Best Visual Effects, and Best Art Direction.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8f4eda432d06a2fb18c921720e81154c8cc052f","amp;dn":"Avatar+DvD+Rio+2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8f4eda432d06a2fb18c921720e81154c8cc052f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,244,237,164,50,208,106,47,177,140,146,23,32,232,17,84,200,204,5,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
