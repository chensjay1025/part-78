But then people keep coming up with interesting new ideas. Selling a love-triangle story between a human, a vampire, and a werewolf was pretty original, and teen girls everywhere ate it up. But Daybreakers is also a fairly interesting idea. What if vampirism really did spread through our modern society? In this day and age when everyone is so connected by technology and people travel the globe in hours instead of weeks or months, how quickly does disease really spread. Add fifty years, and it's no wonder that the now-vampire dominated society is facing a food crisis as there aren't enough humans to produce human blood to feed the rest of the world. It doesn't help that vampires rarely die, so the population only increases.\n\nTo me, that's what makes this film interesting. As an action film, it's pretty blah. But the premise of the film is quite gripping. It makes watching the film worth at least a glance. The acting isn't bad, which also helps.\n\nI didn't know any interesting trivia for this film, so I looked one up on IMDb that isn't bad. On the other hand, IMDb's trivia page says the film was shot in 2007 ... and I keep wondering, 'how is that even interesting enough to be trivia?' If the film was shot in like 1997 and released in 2009, that would be interesting, but how is it interesting or abnormal for a film released in January of 2009 to be shot in 2007? That's the definition of normalcy.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTrivia\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1. The makers of the movie hosted a contest in Worth1000.com (famous photo manipulation-contest site) to come up with images of how the world would look if nearly everyone were a vampire.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nScreen Shots\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------- &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/dayb1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/dayb1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/dayb2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/dayb2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/dayb3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/dayb3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/dayb4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/dayb4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/dayb5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/dayb5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/dayb6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/dayb6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/dayb7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/dayb7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/dayb8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/dayb8.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAdditional Info\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLike all my iPod torrents, these files have their ID3 tags preformatted for your ease!
