In an effort to make the\nmovie more marketable, they attempt to recruit a number of big name stars\nto appear, while the studio's creditors attempt to thwart them. The film\ncontains only one word of dialogue, spoken by an unlikely source. \n\nStarring: Mel Brooks, Marty Feldman and Dom DeLuise \nDirector: Mel Brooks\n\n\nVideo: MPEG2PAL 16:9 720x576\n\nAusio: English Dolby AC3/2\n\nSubs: Dansk, Norsk, Suomi, Svenska\n\n\nExtras: Mel Brooks trailers; Silent Movie, High Anxiety and\n                             To Be Or Not To Be\n        Photo Galleries: Behind the Scenes, Deleted Scene and Posters\n        Trailers: Sweet Smell of Success, Thunderbolt and Lightfoot\n                  Code of Silence and The Killing\n      \n\nIMDB: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075222/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075222/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nNOTE: In Sweden most of Mel Brooks films were titled &quot;Det vÃƒÂ¥ras fÃƒÂ¶r ...&quot; which\n      means &quot;It's springtime for ...&quot; This emanates from the song &quot;Springtime\n      for Hitler&quot; that was sung in the film &quot;The Producers&quot;.\n      Example:\n      Det vÃƒÂ¥ras fÃƒÂ¶r Hitler (It's springtime for Hitler) - The Producers\n      Det vÃƒÂ¥ras fÃƒÂ¶r galningarna (It's springtime for the maniacs) - High Anxiety\n      Det vÃƒÂ¥ras fÃƒÂ¶r sheriffen (It's springtime for the sheriff) -\n                              Blazing Saddles\n      Det vÃƒÂ¥ras fÃƒÂ¶r stumfilmen (It's springtime for the silent movie) -\n                               Silent Movie\n\n      This maybe makes it understandable why the set were this film is included\n      is named &quot;Det vÃƒÂ¥ras fÃƒÂ¶r Mel Brooks&quot; (It's springtime for Mel Brooks).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5bb7ef7ae4b07700262d062463ec0618539eee89","amp;dn":"Silent+Movie+%28Mel+Brooks%29+%5B1976%5D+Nordic+subs++DVDrip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5bb7ef7ae4b07700262d062463ec0618539eee89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,183,239,122,228,176,119,0,38,45,6,36,99,236,6,24,83,158,238,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
