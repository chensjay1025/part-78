For one thing, his nickname\n is &quot;Professor Peculiar.&quot; For another, as this exclusive off-kilter discussion of\n his craft demonstrates, Uhls is eager to break the first rule of Fight Club : He\n talks about Fight Club. A lot. That seminal film, directed by David Fincher\n (Se7en, Panic Room), pushed every boundary possible for a studio movie, and Uhls'\n darkly funny script, adapted from the Chuck Palahniuk novel, is a wickedly\n subversive example of how to successfully adapt an &quot;unadaptable&quot; book. Step inside\n the mind of the man who figured out how to do it, as Professor Peculiar explains\n how to use a newspaper story approach to build a brilliant pitch, why you should\n interview your characters, how to know when to &quot;stick a fork&quot; in your screenplay,\n and the macabre particulars of how and why he had to murder his brother's cat. \n\n\n  \n enjoy!                                                                  \n                                                                               \n                                                                               \n                                                                               \n                                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                                     \n      Release notes                                                        \n                                                                     \n                                                              \n                                                                               \n                                                                               \n                                                                               \n                                                                               \n                                                                    \n                                                                     \n     Greetings                                                             \n                                                                     \n                                                                    \n                                                                               \n                                                                               \nNTX aAF FiCO HNR CiNEFiLE AEN HUMANiSM","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbb78c8d58b808215b3a6d9798f662e6ca07ec36","amp;dn":"The.Dialogue.Jim.Uhls.2006.WS.DVDRip.XviD-SPRiNTER","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbb78c8d58b808215b3a6d9798f662e6ca07ec36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,183,140,141,88,184,8,33,91,58,109,151,152,246,98,230,202,7,236,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
