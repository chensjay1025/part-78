All James wants is to become a bona fide agent and see some real action. So when he's offered his first senior-level assignment, he can't believe his good luck until he meets his new partner, special agent Charlie Wax (John Travolta) - a trigger-happy, wisecracking, loose cannon who's been sent to Paris to stop a terrorist attack. Wax leads James on a white-knuckle shooting spree through the Parisian underworld that has James praying for his desk job. But when James discovers he's a target of the same crime ring they're trying to bust, he realizes there's no turning back...and that Wax himself might be his only hope for making it through the next forty-eight hours alive.\n\nOriginal Source DVD RETAIL\nRelease Length 92 min\n\nVideo Codec Type:  XviD\nVideo Codec Name: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nBitrate: 1 655 Kbps\nEncoding: 2 Pass\nResolution: 720x304\nQuality Factor (QF): 0.315\nFrame Rate: 23.976 fps\nDisplay Aspect Ratio: 2.35:1\nSize: 1.07 GiB (78%)\n\nAudio Codec: AC-3\nBitrate: 448 Kbps\nBitrate Type: Constant\nSample Rate: 48.0 KHz\nChannels: 6 channels\nSize: 297 MiB (21%)\n\ncredit IZON BIG BIG BIG TIME &amp; to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)\n\n*****help what we can with others in need...the world is ONE big family*****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d0c7f653dd37a8d51327d6babcefcbdbcb987fc","amp;dn":"From+Paris+With+Love+DVDRip+XviD+AC3-IZON%28Kingdom-Release%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d0c7f653dd37a8d51327d6babcefcbdbcb987fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,12,127,101,61,211,122,141,81,50,125,107,171,206,252,189,188,185,135,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
