The shape, the speed, and the mood of each ride is determined by the song you choose. \nYou earn points for clustering together blocks of the same color on the highway, and compete with others on the internet for the high score on your favorite songs.\n\nThis is the STEAM version of Audiosurf. You must have steam installed and be able to run for it to work. Instructions are in the .rar file. Not much else to say except Enjoy, Fellow Piraters.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d792d4bad9a8cb52e88437d40ccb67c00f618f7","amp;dn":"Audiosurf+Game+%28STEAM+USERS%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d792d4bad9a8cb52e88437d40ccb67c00f618f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,121,45,75,173,154,140,181,46,136,67,125,64,204,182,124,0,246,24,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
