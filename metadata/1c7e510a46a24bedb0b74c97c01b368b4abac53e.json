The project's working title was Basement Tapes, (probably referring to the album of the same name) but it was renamed RiP!: A Remix Manifesto prior to theatrical release. Gaylor encourages more people to create their own remixes from this movie, using media available from the Open Source Cinema website, or other websites like Flickr, Hulu or MySpace.\n\n\nAudio\n- Codec ........: mp4a\n- Channels .....: Stereo\n- Sample rate ..: 4800 Hz\n- AAC extension : SBR\n\nVideo\n- Codec ........: avc1\n- Resolution ...: 1280x720\n- Frame rate ...: 23.976023","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c7e510a46a24bedb0b74c97c01b368b4abac53e","amp;dn":"RIP%21%3A+A+remix+manifesto+%281280x720%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c7e510a46a24bedb0b74c97c01b368b4abac53e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,126,81,10,70,162,75,237,176,183,76,151,192,27,54,139,74,186,197,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
