I found\nthese in an old box of VHS tapes cleaning up my \nbasement. If you're into poorly dubbed wacko kungfu\nmovies, where a punch makes a high snapping noise,\nand lip movements don't match the dialog, these are\nfor you. Once again, I love the cockney accents on \nthese chinese people, LOL. The Pan&amp;Scan is from the\nVHS, not my doing (it's most obvious on &quot;THE END&quot; \nat the end.) Again, if you know the original movie,\nplease enlighten the rest of us.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a896d534a1d6ce727c92ff764e45ac63b1c0f38","amp;dn":"Hard.Bastard.VHSRip.XviD-AMiGOS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a896d534a1d6ce727c92ff764e45ac63b1c0f38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,137,109,83,74,29,108,231,39,201,47,247,100,228,90,198,59,28,15,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
