Her experience in this method takes an unexpected turn when an FBI agent comes to ask for a desperate favour. They had just tracked down a notorious serial killer, Carl Stargher, whose MO is to abduct women one at a time and place them in a secret area where they are kept for about 40 hours until they are slowly drowned. Unfortunately, the killer has fallen into an irreversible coma which means he cannot confess where he has taken his latest victim before she dies. Now, Catherine Deane must race against time to explore the twisted mind of the killer to get the information she needs, but Stargher's damaged personality poses dangers that threaten to overwhelm her.  Written by Kenneth Chisholm\nIMDb\n\n\n--Other Stuff--\n\nMy WMV files NEVER have DRM or make you download a trojan. Make sure to mark ones that do as fakes.\nIf the movie looks muddy or smeary(it shouldn't), then update your WMV3 codec.  I recommend K-lite. This is a Dvdrip but it is not high resolution.  I think it looks fine enough. If it is too dark, then adjust the gamma in the &quot;tools,effects and filters,video effects&quot; menu in VLC.\n\n(C) INEREL PIRACY,Inc  All Rights deserved.\n\nThink of others, please seed the torrent.  \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a4193159f2d6e1d4a586cd038a5265792938b68","amp;dn":"The.Cell%5B2000%5DDvDrip%5BEng%5D-iNerel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a4193159f2d6e1d4a586cd038a5265792938b68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,65,147,21,159,45,110,29,74,88,108,208,56,165,38,87,146,147,139,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
