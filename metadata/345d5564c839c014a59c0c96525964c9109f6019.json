Wukimon takes the listener on a subway ride to the carnival where no party-poopers are welcome. \n\nMost of Wukimon's songs are rather mellow electronica songs with influences from indiepop and triphop as well as folk. The music is likely to appeal to fans of artists such as Bjork, The Knife, Mum, Depeche Mode, Tunng, Psapp, Portishead and Massive Attack.\n\nIf you like Wukimon and wish to support the band you can buy this release as well as others at http://www.wukimon.bandcamp.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:345d5564c839c014a59c0c96525964c9109f6019","amp;dn":"Wukimon+-+Let+the+Carnival+Begin%21+%5BSwedish+Indie+Electronica%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"345d5564c839c014a59c0c96525964c9109f6019","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,93,85,100,200,57,192,20,165,156,12,150,82,89,100,201,16,159,96,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
