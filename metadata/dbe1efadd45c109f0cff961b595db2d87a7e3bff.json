Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Take It HomeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ speaks as an homage to his roots, his fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music and to the legacies of those he respects, while revealing JubalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s enormous talent.\n\nThe lead track nods to Waylon in a great rockinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ cover of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Just To Satisy You.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ He has the same driven energy in Ã¢â‚¬Å“There AinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t No Outlaws AnymoreÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ where he denounces all the wannabe outlaws coming out of Nashville. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s soulful, but heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pissed. And it works. Really, really well.\n\nJubal can turn light and upbeat without hesitation, as in the very catchy Ã¢â‚¬Å“Neon River,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a song for his favorite Texas town, Houston. More fun abound in the humorous Ã¢â‚¬Å“You Only Call Me When YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re Drunk.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Many of us have been there, right?)\n\nHonoring papa Young by recording two of his songs on the album, Jubal does an outstanding rendition of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Renegade PickerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (the title track to his dadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first RCA album), a fun, rebel rousing tune. Ã¢â‚¬Å“HeyÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦(his voice soars as he hangs on the word) .. I was born down in Dixie, I grew up in the south, listening to good music, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m all aboutÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ It moves and youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll move happily along with it. The other is the strong cut, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Riding Down The Highway.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Jubal belts it out here with soul and grit in a resounding anthem for the life of a musician on the road.\n\nWhen it comes to the ballads, JLY has got this, too. His strong, emotion filled vibrato draws you in as itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ringing out the heartbreaking Ã¢â‚¬Å“DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t You Dare Love Her,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ -a warning that when a woman says sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll run, she means it, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Angel With A Broken HeartÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a story of a heartworn musician. The intense Ã¢â‚¬Å“Why Does It Always Rain?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a standout track with so much potency, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll want to play it again, and again. The gentle and very beautiful Ã¢â‚¬Å“Good To YouÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ letÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a woman know she deserves so much better than what sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been given. This song shows yet another side of JubalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s versatile interpretations, and the delicacy in which itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s delivered gives it a quiet, resonant power.\n\nThis album is one of the best IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve heard all year.\nIt covers every aspect of human emotion.\nFlawlessly.\nTake It Home. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll love it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbe1efadd45c109f0cff961b595db2d87a7e3bff","amp;dn":"Jubal+Lee+Young+-+Take+It+Home+%5B2011%5D%5BFLAC%2FWEB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbe1efadd45c109f0cff961b595db2d87a7e3bff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,225,239,173,212,92,16,159,12,255,150,27,89,93,178,216,122,126,59,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
