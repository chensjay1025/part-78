It also knocked Elvis Presley out of No. 1 on Billboard's Country Albums chart.\n\nSimple Dreams was Ronstadt's fifth consecutive million-selling Platinum album and sold over 3Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ million copies in less than a year in the United States alone ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a record for a female artist. It elevated Ronstadt to mega-superstar status and the highest paid female singer in the world.\n\nOriginally, the front cover would have had Linda dressed in a provocative mini-slip seated in front of multiple mirrors; instead, she put on a robe, and the photograph was made artificially grainy. An outtake photo from the original photo sessions was belatedly included on the sleeve for her Greatest Hits, Volume 2 album in 1980.\n\nThis album has never been out of print.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:797f746d2ef03fce02c9db178396519e5a9936e9","amp;dn":"Linda+Ronstadt+-+Simple+Dreams+%5B1977%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"797f746d2ef03fce02c9db178396519e5a9936e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,127,116,109,46,240,63,206,2,201,219,23,131,150,81,158,90,153,54,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
