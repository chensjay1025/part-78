The compilation was a complete repackaging of the band's first three albums (Rush, Fly by Night and Caress of Steel). Originally released with a faded grey cover, it was later repackaged with a darker, black cover. The minimalist cover art recycles the image of the &quot;Man in the Star&quot; from the 2112 album.\n\nOn the original, vinyl Fly By Night album, the chimes at the end of &quot;By-Tor and the Snow Dog&quot; were printed into the fadeout groove of side one. This meant that on older turntables the chimes would play on forever, until the stylus was physically lifted from the vinyl. On the Archives version, &quot;By-Tor&quot; is 28 seconds longer as these additional chimes were included.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\nDisc 1 - Rush:\n\n    &quot;Finding My Way&quot;\n    &quot;Need Some Love&quot;\n    &quot;Take a Friend&quot;\n    &quot;Here Again&quot;\n    &quot;What You're Doing&quot;\n    &quot;In the Mood&quot;\n    &quot;Before and After&quot;\n    &quot;Working Man&quot;\n\nDisc 2 - Fly by Night:\n\n    &quot;Anthem&quot;\n    &quot;Best I Can&quot;\n    &quot;Beneath, Between &amp; Behind&quot;\n    &quot;By-Tor &amp; The Snow Dog&quot;\n        &quot;At The Tobes of Hades&quot;\n        &quot;Across the Styx&quot;\n        &quot;Of the Battle&quot;\n            &quot;Challenge and Defiance&quot;\n            &quot;7/4 War Furor&quot;\n            &quot;Aftermath&quot;\n            &quot;Hymn of Triumph&quot;\n        &quot;Epilogue&quot;\n    &quot;Fly by Night&quot;\n    &quot;Making Memories&quot;\n    &quot;Rivendell&quot;\n    &quot;In the End&quot;\n\nDisc 3 - Caress of Steel:\n\n    &quot;Bastille Day&quot;\n    &quot;I Think I'm Going Bald&quot;\n    &quot;Lakeside Park&quot;\n    &quot;The Necromancer&quot;\n        &quot;Into Darkness&quot;\n        &quot;Under the Shadow&quot;\n        &quot;Return of the Prince&quot;\n    &quot;The Fountain of Lamneth&quot;\n        &quot;In the Valley&quot;\n        &quot;Didacts and Narpets&quot;\n        &quot;No One at the Bridge&quot;\n        &quot;Panacea&quot;\n        &quot;Bacchus Plateau&quot;\n        &quot;The Fountain&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0260ef6db08ee39606f8d71120e9e397b9575e7","amp;dn":"Rush+-+Archives+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0260ef6db08ee39606f8d71120e9e397b9575e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,38,14,246,219,8,238,57,96,111,141,113,18,14,158,57,123,149,117,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
