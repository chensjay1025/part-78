Latest find, a statuette, radiometrically dates to 5200 AD! When this draws colleague Richard Hedges to the island lab, Erling reveals that 20th-century objects put in the machine seem to be &quot;traded&quot; for analogous future objects by intelligent life. And on the sly, Victor's been trying to get a living visitor. Does the future need help, or is the present in danger?

In other words: the method can be applied to such materials as wood, leather and bone - but not metal or mineral.\n\n\nFactual errors: Professor Erling claims he didn't know the statue was radioactive after he carbon-14 dated it. However, carbon-14, in addition to being itself a radioactive isotope, would certainly reveal the presence of any existent radioactivity.\n\n\nFactual errors: Although the narrator claims the first satellite launched by &quot;man&quot; was in 1958, it was actually the Soviet Union's Sputnik 1 that was first on October 4, 1957. Interestingly, the first *American* satellite, Explorer I, was indeed launched on January 31, 1958 (February 1 in GMT).\n\n\nBoom mic visible: In the scene where the two scientists to whom Dr. Hedges has sent the statue for analysis discover it is radioactive, the shadow of the boom microphone can be seen on the window blinds.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:368c19f7d93f66b38af745392732948d725001e1","amp;dn":"Terror+From+The+Year+5%2C000.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"368c19f7d93f66b38af745392732948d725001e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,140,25,247,217,63,102,179,138,247,69,57,39,50,148,141,114,80,1,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
