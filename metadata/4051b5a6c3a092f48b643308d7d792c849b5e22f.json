But Bob has one more mission to complete before Gillian agrees to marry him: winning over her three opinionated kids (Madeline Carroll, Will Shadley and Alina Foley). When Gillian suddenly has to leave town because her father was playing softball and hurt his hip, Bob volunteers to babysit the children so he can earn their approval. But when one of the kids mistakenly downloads a top-secret formula from his computer, Bob's archenemy, a Russian terrorist named Poldark, moves in for the attack, forcing Bob to juggle the roles of spy and prospective stepfather in the most challenging mission of his career. Bob asks Colton James (Billy Ray Cyrus), his spy partner, to help him, but he is not sure if he can trust Colton. Matters are further complicated when a Russain spy, Larry (Lucas Till) attacks Bob, forcing him to tell the kids that he is a spy. In addition, Bob learns that his boss, Glaze (George Lopez), is actually working for Poldark and the Russians\n\nIMAGENES &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img256.imageshack.us/img256/4923/51122138.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img256.imageshack.us/img256/4923/51122138.png&lt;/a&gt;\nhttp://img80.imageshack.us/img80/5395/48767169.png\nhttp://img13.imageshack.us/img13/3729/27554228.png\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=http://www.savetubevideo.com/ &gt;downloadideos&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4051b5a6c3a092f48b643308d7d792c849b5e22f","amp;dn":"The+Spy+Next+Door++por+memitoxxx+etorrents.org+%28+ingles+-sub++la","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4051b5a6c3a092f48b643308d7d792c849b5e22f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,81,181,166,195,160,146,244,139,100,51,8,215,215,146,200,73,181,226,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
