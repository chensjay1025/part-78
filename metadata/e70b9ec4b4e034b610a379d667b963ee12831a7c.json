Wyoming. A loose depiction of the 'Johnson County War'.\n\nFarm settlements along a river have cut off a wealthy rancher's\nlivestock from the water. The rancher presses the farmers to\nleave. He looks to be succeeding ... \n\n... and then Shane rides into the valley. \n\nThis play was made for the 'Cinema 100 Season', but is based on\nthe novel 'Shane' [rather than the film]. The Shane depicted here\nis a samurai character type. Calm. Terrible. Vicious. \n\nDon't be put off by the cowboy theme. This is a model piece of\nstory telling. Spare and touching. It bears repeated listening.\nMy tape wore out long before digitisation became available. I\nwas really happy to get this copy. So thanks again!\n\nCast\nStacy Keach \nDavid Dukes \nChristopher Curry \nGregg Almquist \nTuck Milligan \nLawri Means \nMarty York \n.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e70b9ec4b4e034b610a379d667b963ee12831a7c","amp;dn":"BBC+R4+-+Jack+Schaefer%5C%27s+%5C%27Shane%5C%27+sp7","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e70b9ec4b4e034b610a379d667b963ee12831a7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,11,158,196,180,224,52,182,16,163,121,214,103,185,99,238,18,131,26,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
