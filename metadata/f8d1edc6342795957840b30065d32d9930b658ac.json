Despite dire warnings by fellow scientist Ted Rampian, Dr Sorenson proceeds with the experiment after secretly learning that he is terminally ill. This experiment causes a crack to form and grow within the earth's crust, which threatens to split the earth in two if it is not stopped in time.\n\n\nThis is an ISO ripped from a homemade DVD. \n\nThe film itself is only of VCR quality.\n\nA torrent exists for this film here but the OP stopped seeding before anybody had the full file. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/3776217/Crack_in_the_World_(1965)_DVD-R&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/3776217/Crack_in_the_World_(1965)_DVD-R&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nHave been looking for this for ages.
