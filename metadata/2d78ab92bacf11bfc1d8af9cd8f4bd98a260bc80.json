Six years later, his vengeful step-brother Yuang returns from war unrecognizably consumed by Dark Martial Arts and armed with his Five Venom Fist, which he wields to severely injure Su as payback for a long and dark family history. Su and his wife barely escape with their lives, but their son is now held captive by an increasingly psychotic Yuang. Over many long and difficult months, Su recovers from his injuries and once again hones his craft with the help of a mysterious Bearded Man and his apprentice, Lord Wushu, a Golden Monk of unimaginable martial arts virtuosity. But even with this training, Su is unable to save his wifeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s life when she single-handedly stakes out to find their son. Utterly broken by grief, Su soon wanders the streets as a drunken beggar with no will to live. It is only when his son is once again threatened, this time by imperial Westerners out to shame the Chinese people, that an inebriated Su summons all his fighting skills to save the day and unwittingly forges a new style of martial arts forever known as The Drunken Fist!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d78ab92bacf11bfc1d8af9cd8f4bd98a260bc80","amp;dn":"True+Legend+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d78ab92bacf11bfc1d8af9cd8f4bd98a260bc80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,120,171,146,186,207,17,191,193,216,175,156,216,244,189,152,162,96,188,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
