Reynolds in particular comes across as an interesting character, but gives nothing away about the whereabouts of the money (he claims all his has long gone) or the identities of those who were never caught.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4356c6570ae7fe5c9b51789706607ad1bc0c00aa","amp;dn":"Great+Train+Robbery.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4356c6570ae7fe5c9b51789706607ad1bc0c00aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,86,198,87,10,231,254,92,155,81,120,151,6,96,122,209,188,12,0,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
