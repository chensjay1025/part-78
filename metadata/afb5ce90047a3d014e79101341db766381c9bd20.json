Over 30 credible eyewitnesses, children, scientists,\nmilitary, pilots and experts give compelling testimony to the reality of these mysterious global visitations,\nincluding former AZ Gov. Fife Symington who discloses that he witnessed the event and it wasn't\nmilitary! Astronaut and moon walker Dr. Edgar Mitchell, Sc.D. confirms that these phenomena are\nreal! A Commercial &amp; Vietnam pilot witnessed the silent, mile wide craft glide above his head. A Veteran\n911 Phoenix Police operator tells all about that fateful night. NASA footage confirms that these\nphenomena are here.
