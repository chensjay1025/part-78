I have a personal friend who worked on this project, and the movies are hard to find on the internet and rarely get rerun, so I want to make sure people can see these engaging documentaries.\n\n\n\nFrom ESPN's 30 for 30 official site for King's Ransom:\n\nOn August 9, 1988, the NHL was forever changed with the single stroke of a pen. The Edmonton Oilers, fresh off their fourth Stanley Cup victory in five years, signed a deal that sent Wayne Gretzky, a Canadian national treasure and the greatest hockey player ever to play the game, to the Los Angeles Kings in a multi-player, multi-million dollar deal. As bewildered Oiler fans struggled to make sense of the unthinkable, fans in Los Angeles were rushing to purchase season tickets at a rate so fast it overwhelmed the Kings box office. Overnight, a franchise largely overlooked in its 21-year existence was suddenly playing to sellout crowds and standing ovations, and a league often relegated to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œlittle brotherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ status exploded from 21 teams to 30 in less than a decade. Acclaimed director Peter Berg presents the captivating story of the trade that knocked the wind out of an entire country, and placed a star-studded city right at the humble feet of a 27-year-old kid, known simply as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Great One.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n\nAbout 30 for 30:\n\n[30 for 30] is an unprecedented documentary series featuring thirty films from some of todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s finest storytellers. Each filmmaker will bring their passion and personal point of view to their film detailing the issues, trends, athletes, teams, rivalries, games and events that transformed the sports landscape from 1979 to 2009.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e60a777bc767d90c8739403dd8bbce3323cbaa19","amp;dn":"ESPN+-+30+for+30%3A+King%5C%27s+Ransom+%28HD+720p%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e60a777bc767d90c8739403dd8bbce3323cbaa19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,10,119,123,199,103,217,12,135,57,64,61,216,187,206,51,35,203,170,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
