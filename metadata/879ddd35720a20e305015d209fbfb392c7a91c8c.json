A fascinating precursor to Zeppelin and highly collectable material. \n\n\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n\n01. Cause I Love You\n02. Gutty Guitar\n03. Union Jack Car\n04. Flashing Lights\n05. Wailing Sounds\n06. Thumping Beat\n07. Would You Believe\n08. Smoke And Fire\n09. One For You, Baby\n\n\n\n10. L-O-N-D-O-N\n11. Brightest Light\n12. Baby, Come Back\n13. Everything I Do Is Wrong\n14.
