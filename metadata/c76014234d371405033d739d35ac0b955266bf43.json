KevinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s recordings over the last more than thirty years (via solo work, The Bothy Band, collaborations with the late MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­cheÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡l ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Domhnaill, Patrick Street, Open House, the Celtic Fiddle Festival and very much more) have revealed his ability to run the gamut from the sheer delights of delicacy to a passionate embracing of the more driving elements of his motherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s native Sligo style, while his ears have always remained open to the possibilities of experimentation.\n\nHis latest album, the entrancing Across the Black River, is no exception to the above rules of thumb, though does perhaps reveal a more reflective side of BurkeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s musical persona. Accompanied by guitarist Cal Scott (an Oregonian with his own musically exploratory history, who also provides three of his own noteworthy compositions), KevinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fiddle twists and turns through a sparkling array of predominantly traditional tunes, plus a whirlwind rendition of Bill MonroeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Evening Prayer Blues, before culminating in Phil CunninghamÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s elegiac For Johnny, penned for KevinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s late partner in the Celtic Fiddle Festival - Irishmusicreview\n\nlow on bandwidth help seed, usually off from 12am GMT so be patient","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c76014234d371405033d739d35ac0b955266bf43","amp;dn":"Across+the+Black+River","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c76014234d371405033d739d35ac0b955266bf43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,96,20,35,77,55,20,5,3,61,115,157,53,172,11,149,82,102,191,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
