Piper hit the evangelical scene after the publication of his book Desiring God: Meditations of a Christian Hedonist (1986) and has continued to publish dozens of other books further articulating this theological perspective. In 1994, he founded Desiring God Ministries, which provides all of Piper's sermons and articles from the past three decades, and most of his books online free of charge, as well as offering for sale books, CDs, and DVDs and regularly hosting conferences.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d2eadbda556d21c36fdd4f37b8362b8c9432500","amp;dn":"John+Piper","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d2eadbda556d21c36fdd4f37b8362b8c9432500","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,46,173,189,165,86,210,28,54,253,212,243,123,131,98,184,201,67,37,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
