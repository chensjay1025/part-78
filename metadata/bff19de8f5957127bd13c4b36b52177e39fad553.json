You have to be a major fan to sit through all of Do Your Shows Always Suck?, and while it is hilarious in parts, it is woefully sloppy. Being a scatterbrained, raging bisexual who always has one foot in rehab is Dick's shtick, so it would be silly to expect something tidy, but there are and have been plenty of other reckless comedians who packaged their chaos with the audience in mind. They feel spontaneous; this feels unrehearsed as it rambles off in every direction with long stretches between punch lines. The shocking songs with acoustic guitars are the highlights and they appear with greater frequency on the album's superior second half. Sight jokes aren't edited out and Dick isn't that good of an improviser, either, with any interruption from the audience throwing him off, forcing him to use sick-o potty humor to worm his way out of it. Being there is probably a totally different story since Dick's mannerisms and &quot;look&quot; are important to the whole package. Do Your Shows Always Suck? seems completely unaware of this and even the biggest Andy Dick fan would have to admit he could be packaged much better than this. \n\nAndy Dick - 01 - Therapy\nAndy Dick - 02 - Squirrels\nAndy Dick - 03 - One Friends\nAndy Dick - 04 - I'm Adopted\nAndy Dick - 05 - Ellen DeGeneres\nAndy Dick - 06 - Poke A Hontas\nAndy Dick - 07 - Beautiful Urinal\nAndy Dick - 08 - Homecoming King\nAndy Dick - 09 - Niggers!\nAndy Dick - 10 - Water On The Brain\nAndy Dick - 11 - Cock &amp; Balls\nAndy Dick - 12 - My Mother\nAndy Dick - 13 - Cancerous Testical\nAndy Dick - 14 - Look At Me\nAndy Dick - 15 - Ballad Of Andy\nAndy Dick - 16 - Punkin' Lovin'\nAndy Dick - 17 - Before AYDS Came Out\nAndy Dick - 18 - Good Luck With That\nAndy Dick - 19 - Chocolate Martini\nAndy Dick - 20 - Little Brown Ring\nAndy Dick - 21 - Damn Good Pussy\nAndy Dick - 22 - Do Your Shows Always Suck\nAndy Dick - 23 - Dirty Sanchez-v-Hot Karl\nAndy Dick - 24 - Jerkin' Off A Wombat\nAndy Dick - 25 - Trash-Elle\nAndy Dick - 26 - Would You Rather\nAndy Dick - 27 - Another Great Day For Drugs\nAndy Dick - 28 - Mom, You Fucking Whore\nAndy Dick - 29 - Where Did I Go Wrong\nAndy Dick - 30 - Dip Your Cock In Vodka\nAndy Dick - 31 - My Friend Drank So Much Liquor\nAndy Dick - 32 - Leonard's Ass Is Bleeding\nAndy Dick - 33 - Bartender Friendly\nAndy Dick - 34 - Angry Pirate","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bff19de8f5957127bd13c4b36b52177e39fad553","amp;dn":"Standup+Comedy+-+Andy+Dick+-+Do+Your+Shows+Always+Suck%3F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bff19de8f5957127bd13c4b36b52177e39fad553","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,241,157,232,245,149,113,39,189,19,196,179,107,82,23,126,57,250,213,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
