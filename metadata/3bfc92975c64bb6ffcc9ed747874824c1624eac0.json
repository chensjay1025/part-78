It is the title track and first track of their album Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap, released in September 1976, and was written by Angus Young, Malcolm Young, and Bon Scott.\n\nIt was also released as a single - first in Australia in October 1976 with &quot;R.I.P. (Rock in Peace)&quot; as its B-side, and then in the UK in January 1977 as a maxi-single with &quot;Big Balls&quot; and &quot;The Jack&quot; as its B-sides. Once the Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap album was finally released in the US in 1981 the &quot;Dirty Deeds...&quot; single was released there (backed by &quot;Highway To Hell&quot;), where it reached number four on the charts.\n\nThe song ranked #24 on VH1's 40 Greatest Metal Songs and in 2009 it was named the 31st best hard rock song of all time also by VH1.\n\nIt features a backing vocal consisting of a heavy breathing sound, made on the downbeat during verses. It also features the title in a spoken-word style at the end of the chorus; plus a scream at the end of the song. The full length recording (approximately 4:11) has the title of the song chanted four times starting at 3:09, but on the more common edited version (approximately 3:51) the chant is heard only twice.\n\n&quot;Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap&quot; has only been included on one official AC/DC live album, 1992's Live, sung by Scott's replacement Brian Johnson. This live version was released as a single. A video clip for the single was released containing footage from the Live at Donington  home video, as well as other old clips mixed in the video.\n\nAn earlier version with Bon Scott, recorded live in Sydney (Haymarket) at the Festival of Sydney on 30 January 1977, was released on an Australian only radio 2JJ compilation album titled Long Live The Evolution.\n\nIn 2007 on the Plug Me In three track bonus CD from Best Buy, a live version from Detroit, MI (Joe Louis Arena) 17 or 18 November 1983 was released.\n\nDirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap is the third studio album by Australian  hard rock band AC/DC, released in 1976. All songs were written by Angus Young, Malcolm Young, and Bon Scott.\n\nIt was originally released in Australia on Albert Productions on 20 September 1976. A modified international edition was later released on Atlantic Records in November 1976.\n\nThe album has been certified 6x Platium in U.S., which means that it has sold a total of 6 million copies sold, becoming the third highest sold album by AC/DC in the U.S. after &quot;Highway to Hell&quot; and &quot;Back in Black&quot;.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3bfc92975c64bb6ffcc9ed747874824c1624eac0","amp;dn":"AC%2FDC+-+Dirty+Deeds+Done+Dirt+Cheap++%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3bfc92975c64bb6ffcc9ed747874824c1624eac0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,252,146,151,92,100,187,111,252,201,237,116,120,116,130,76,22,36,234,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
