That would mean at best only 11% of the oil is being captured by ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCut &amp; CapÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\n\nMeanwhile, BP wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t come clean on what toxins are in the million plus gallons of dispersants used thus far, and the toxic stew of crude and dispersants is of grave concern to human reproductive health, both on the Gulf Coast and beyond.\n\nBPÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s other spill: half a million pounds of benzene and other chemicals were released into the air in April and May from the same Texas refinery where 15 died in 2005. Not previously made public, BPÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s own internal investigations tell a shameful story of reckless disregard for safety. And Shell and ExxonMobil are said to be licking their chops at the prospect of a BP takeover.\n\nObama was on NBCÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Today Show this morning, weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll bring you the highlights including the quest to find out ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œwhose ass needs to be kickedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (video below). And is this the disaster in the Gulf ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œObamaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Katrina?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Sure, if by Obama you mean Cheney (more).\n\nThe number of spills in US waters have more than quadrupled this decade!  From the 1953 coup in Iran to the 2010 spill in the Gulf, BP was there. And Dem vs. GOP, black vs. white, Con vs. LibÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ public opinion of BP is just another example of an America divided.\n\nAlso, as people go to the polls today, there are nine races worth watching across the country. The Daily Show &amp; Colbert Report remember Helen Thomas. A study 25 years in the making suggests that children raised by lesbian parents have fewer behavioral problems. And what to look for on the new iPhone.\n\nThese stories, your calls, and much more on todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Randi Rhodes Show!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5407f1a327de99e93a616210c2215b6ceaa9a546","amp;dn":"Randi+Rhodes+Show+-+June+08+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5407f1a327de99e93a616210c2215b6ceaa9a546","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,7,241,163,39,222,153,233,58,97,98,16,194,33,91,108,234,169,165,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
