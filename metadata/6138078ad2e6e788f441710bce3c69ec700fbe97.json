Idol is too big (XviD is 700MB) and by that unsuitable for many people... especially for the people with bandwidth limitations, as people who requested small-sized AI five-six weeks back and I turned them down. As I've said back then, my &quot;as usual&quot; 720p re-encodes of AI and other live shows always turns bad. Hence, this is XviD re-encode for the people willing to take trade-offs.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6138078ad2e6e788f441710bce3c69ec700fbe97","amp;dn":"American.Idol.S09E24.11.Finalists.Perform.REPACK.H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6138078ad2e6e788f441710bce3c69ec700fbe97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,56,7,138,210,230,231,136,244,65,113,11,206,60,105,236,112,15,190,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
