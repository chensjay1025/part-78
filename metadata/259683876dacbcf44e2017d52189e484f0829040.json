His     |\n|  legendary feature on the two grammy winning song -Mina Hundar- became a   |\n|  controversy on the Swedish hiphop scene, only at the age of 18. After     |\n|  his guest appearance and touring all over Scandinavia, he still did not   |\n|  create music consistently, due to personal reasons and lacking            |\n|  motivation to persuade his own music career but that would took a huge    |\n|  turn on the summer of 2006.                                               |\n|                                                                            |\n|  Henok Achido was born Henok Meharena on the 5th of September 1982,        |\n|  raised in a single parent home in the southern parts of Sweden. The       |\n|  musical influence originated from his family, mainly his mother, uncle &amp;  |\n|  cousins, all huge music fans, which later persuaded him to purchase his   |\n|  first vinyl with the weekly allowance at the age of 8. Although the       |\n|  response for Henok was massive, he still did not feel satisfied with the  |\n|  mind state and lacked maturity and the preparation to be the complete     |\n|  musician he desired. After, Mina Hundar, Henok dropped out of high        |\n|  school and moved to Stockholm to continue recordings but still did not    |\n|  feel that his timing was right. However, that all changed in mid 2006.    |\n|                                                                            |\n|  Henok Achido has always been known for having a strong character, plus    |\n|  the combination of unique flow, determination, cockiness &amp; inventive      |\n|  word play describes Henoks Achido the artist best. In early 2006, Henok   |\n|  recorded a song called 'Million Dollar Baby' that was a groundbreaking    |\n|  change and took him back to the light of music. The song received         |\n|  massive response and was featured in TV (MTV), Radio (P3), Skatefilms     |\n|  (La Famillionaire, Aggressive sport commercial for Stadium), and          |\n|  Compilation albums (Scandinavian Hiphop invasion (Fr), Nu Jerzey Devil &amp;  |\n|  BWS presents Hell Raiser vol.2 (US). The musicvideo for Million Dollar    |\n|  Baby was directed by Tecle Street in the summer in 2006 and shortly       |\n|  after Henok was signed to label DLX entertainment by co-founder Astma.    |\n|  After being signed to DLX, Henok released an 8 track free download EP     |\n|  called -That Fucking Guy The EP- in May 2007 that received more than      |\n|  35.000 downloads worldwide. Furthermore, In October 07, He was asked to   |\n|  perform as supporting act for legendary rapper Rakims' European Tour but  |\n|  unfortunately his tour was cancelled at last minute, however, Henok has   |\n|  already a few artist under his belt as a supporting act such as Saigon    |\n|  (US), DJ Drama (US), Willie Da Kid (US), Onyx (US) and Gangstarr (US).    |\n|                                                                            |\n|  At this moment, Henok is recording his highly anticipated debut album     |\n|  called Almaz Charming Child and did earlier this year also release 2      |\n|  free downloads called Henok vs The Prodigy.1 and 2, where he raps on the  |\n|  legendary techno songs No Good &amp; Magic people. The controversial songs    |\n|  did receive more than 10,000 downloads and controversial discussion       |\n|  regarding his flows' potential and placed his capacity beyond anything    |\n|  else Sweden has ever seen before. The free download EP and songs did      |\n|  also result in Henok starting to receive more attention overseas and was  |\n|  just recently posted as new artist spotlight on two of the biggest U.S    |\n|  hip hop blogs (www.realtalkny.net) and (www.youheardthatnew.com). 2008    |\n|  will be busy year for Henok Achido, at the moment he is recording his     |\n|  album, doing interviews for websites, magazines and radio and has done    |\n|  shows all over Sweden, France, Holland and Poland.
