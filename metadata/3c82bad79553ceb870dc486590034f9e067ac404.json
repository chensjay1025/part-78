They  \n stop on a slight incline, decoupling the first car to let the rest of the    \n train coast back. Their leader is Ryder; he connects by phone with Walter    \n Garber, the dispatcher watching that line. Garber is a supervisor            \n temporarily demoted while being investigated for bribery. Ryder demands $10  \n million within an hour, or he'll start shooting hostages. He'll deal only    \n with Garber. The mayor okays the payoff, the news of the hostage situation   \n sends the stock market tumbling, and it's unclear what Ryder really wants    \n or if Garber is part of the deal. Will hostages, kidnappers, and             \n negotiators live through this?                                               \n                                                                              \n\n--------==========----------\nHappy Hacker Industries \n\nJust a group of friends who believe in quality Audio/Video rips.\nThese rips are made from retail DVD and audio CDs.
