But at the end of the day, it wasn't as good or magical. I kind of felt disappointed because even though the Third Installment was bad I was hoping they went back and recognize their mistakes. But this movie does have its strong points, it was quite funny and entertaining. There were moments in there that felt like the first two films, and overall it is a very enjoyable ride that even though it doesn't live quite up to the first two films. It is worth your money just to have fun with it.\t\t\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:895c93bc8b88b2da743c6da9d6cca490032a7058","amp;dn":"Shrek+Forever+After+%28Movie+Trailer%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"895c93bc8b88b2da743c6da9d6cca490032a7058","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,92,147,188,139,136,178,218,116,60,109,169,214,204,164,144,3,42,112,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
