It's kinda mixed with a few other genres, but it's all good. I like the idea of stepping out of the box, experimenting with various music genres that I have little or no knowledge of whatsoever, doing something totally different from the usual &quot;Reggae, Dancehall &amp; Hip-Hop&quot; mixes which are the majority of Jamaican DJs accustomed route. Let me know what you think.
