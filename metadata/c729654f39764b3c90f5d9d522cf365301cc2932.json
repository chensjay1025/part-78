God Takes Care Of The Little Things\n\n\nAlbum Description\nStrongly influenced by the independent bands of the 1980s, the songs bring to mind the post punk playfulness of altered images, aztec camera and orange juice - a charming rural pop sound with banjos, glockenspiels, acoustic guitars and fiddles thumping away in a home recording folk pop style. a proud exponent of a ramshackle bedroom aesthetic, the music is strangely uplifting hillbilly indie, reminiscent of belle and sebastian, beach boys and dexy's midnight runners. with it's quirky indie folk sound and healthy lo fi feel, it fits neatly alongside contemporary artists such as adem, aidan smith, m craft, the fence collective, misty's big adventure and aberfeldy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c729654f39764b3c90f5d9d522cf365301cc2932","amp;dn":"The+Boy+Least+Likely+To+-+The+Best+Party+Ever","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c729654f39764b3c90f5d9d522cf365301cc2932","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,41,101,79,57,118,75,60,144,245,217,213,34,207,54,83,1,204,41,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
