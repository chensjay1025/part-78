The band was formed in 2006 by Stephanie Dougherty and Billy Brown. Stephanie is best known for her work with the Dropkick Murphys on the song &quot;The Dirty Glass&quot;. Billy singing and playing guitar in Crash and Burn. Soon after the lineup was complete with the addition of Brendan Maguire (Reach the Sky), Nathan Bice (Even in Blackouts), and Joe Packard. They released a self titled EP in Feb. 2006. After some touring, the band went into New Alliance studios in Cambridge, MA to record their debut full length. Coming up from NYC (and sleeping on Bice's couch for a few weeks), was engineer/producer Dean Baltulonis (Hold Steady, Sick of it All, Bouncing Souls) who made the band sound like they knew what they were doing. After the tracking was finished, the band went to NYC to mix the record at Dean's studio, The Wild Arctic. The end result was &quot;Selling Our Weaknesses&quot; Twelve songs the share stories of life, love, betrayal and death. Deadly Sins have toured and shared stages in the US and Europe with the likes of Dropkick Murphys, Against Me!, The Aggrolites, Avail, and The Unseen and will be touring extensively worldwide to support &quot;Selling Our Weaknesses.&quot;\n\n01-deadly_sins-grey_skies_turn.mp3 \n02-deadly_sins-barely_breathing.mp3 \n03-deadly_sins-dial_tone.mp3 \n04-deadly_sins-shipwreck.mp3 \n05-deadly_sins-open_casket.mp3\n06-deadly_sins-riot.mp3 \n07-deadly_sins-ashes.mp3\n08-deadly_sins-freshly_minted_royality.mp3 \n09-deadly_sins-yard_sale.mp3 \n10-deadly_sins-street_lamp.mp3 \n11-deadly_sins-unpaid_bills.mp3\n12-deadly_sins-non-believers.mp3 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31dd34fce652d8d1b6386593c1601245f143ff2d","amp;dn":"Deadly+Sins+-+Selling+Our+Weaknesses+-+2008","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31dd34fce652d8d1b6386593c1601245f143ff2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,221,52,252,230,82,216,209,182,56,101,147,193,96,18,69,241,67,255,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
