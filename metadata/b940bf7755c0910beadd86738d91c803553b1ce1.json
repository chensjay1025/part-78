You'll find the smc_config.bin file in the same folder.\n\nNOTE:\nconfig_raw.bin file must be exactly 33kb in size, else RAW2SMC won't accept it!\nFile validity is NOT being checked. If your config_raw.bin file contains bad data, RAW2SMC will create a smc_config.bin file with\nthe bad data you provided. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!\nRun RAW2SMC_BigBlock_v0.2 if you need a smc_config.bin file for big block Jasper (512/256MB NAND),\nor RAW2SMC_SmallBlock_v0.2 for everything else (16MB NAND).\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b940bf7755c0910beadd86738d91c803553b1ce1","amp;dn":"RAW2SMC+-+coded+by+foouser+-+28%2F04%2F2010+v0.2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b940bf7755c0910beadd86738d91c803553b1ce1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,64,191,119,85,192,145,11,234,221,134,115,141,145,200,3,85,59,28,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
