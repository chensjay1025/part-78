Decades before Neal Armstrong took his ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œgiant leap for mankindÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ two intrepid adventurers from Lympne, England, journeyed there using not a rocket, but an antigravity coating.\n\nMr. Bedford, who narrates the tale, tells of how he fell in with eccentric inventor Mr. Cavor, grew to believe in his researches, helped him build a sphere for traveling in space, and then partnered with him in an expedition to the Moon.\n\nWhat they found was fantastic! There was not only air and water, but the Moon was honeycombed with caverns and tunnels in which lived an advanced civilization of insect-like beings. While Bedford is frightened by them and bolts home, Cavor stays and is treated with great respect.\n\nSo why didn't Armstrong and later astronauts find the evidence of all this? Well, according to broadcasts by Cavor over the newly-discovered radio technology, he told the Selenites too much about mankind, and apparently, they removed the welcome mat! (Summary by Mark)\n\n\n\nAn M4B file is an audio file which can be bookmarked. This is the audio-book file type. These files can have chapter markers which can be skipped through as you would skip through files on a play list. They can have built in cover art and chapter images. They will remember where you left off each time you stop the file and come back to it . And variable speed settings on Ipods and a growing number of other mp3 players can be utilized by this file type. The ability to bookmark allows for as little as one large file instead of many small ones without the burden of fast forwarding to find your spot every time you resume listening or the fear of otherwise losing your place. The reduced number of files also makes browsing through your files to find your book and your place in it much less effort.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a42c86e49d7ed9249f0252a1d5e3ccfde46e3ffc","amp;dn":"Librivox+M4B+-+First+Men+in+the+Moon+by+H.G.+Wells","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a42c86e49d7ed9249f0252a1d5e3ccfde46e3ffc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,44,134,228,157,126,217,36,159,2,82,161,213,227,204,253,228,110,63,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
