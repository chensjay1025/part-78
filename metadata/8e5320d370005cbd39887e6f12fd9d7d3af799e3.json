Brooks and Allan Burns dreamed up an edgy show about a divorced woman with a career, the CBS executives they pitched replied: Ã¢â‚¬Å“American audiences wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t tolerate divorce in a seriesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ lead any more than they will tolerate Jews, people with mustaches, and people who live in New York.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nForty years later, The Mary Tyler Moore Show is one of the most beloved and recognizable television shows of all time. It was an inspiration to a generation of women who wanted to have it all in an era when everything seemed possible.\n\nJennifer Keishin ArmstrongÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Mary and Lou and Rhoda and Ted tells the stories behind the making of this popular classic, introducing the groundbreaking female writers who lent real-life stories to their TV scripts; the men who created the indelible characters; the lone woman network executive who cast the legendary ensembleÃ¢â‚¬â€and advocated for this provocative showÃ¢â‚¬â€and the colorful cast of actors who made it all work. James L. Brooks, Grant Tinker, Allan Burns, Valerie Harper, Cloris Leachman, Betty White, Gavin MacLeod, Ed Asner, Ted Knight, Georgia EngelÃ¢â‚¬â€they all came together to make a show that changed womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lives and television itself. Mary and Lou and Rhoda and Ted is the tale of how they did it.\n\nPublishers Weekly\nThe Mary Tyler Moore Show, which ran for seven seasons (1970Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1977), made it big, and the series remains one of TVÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most acclaimed, with 29 Emmys total. Entertainment writer ArmstrongÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s affectionate and meticulous history offers a captivating behind-the-scenes look at all of the personalities who turned the show into a success. Fast-paced and charming, ArmstrongÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s chronicle brings to life writers Treva Silverman (who wrote scripts for The Monkees), Allan Burns (My Mother the Car), and James L. Brooks (Rhoda; Taxi), who labored mightily in 1970 on the scripts for Mary Tyler Moore. The show pulled Moore back from the brink of the career disasters since the end of The Dick Van Dyke Show, and created for her a forceful persona surrounded by actors such as the irascible Ed Asner, the indefatigable Betty White, and the lovably eccentric Valerie Harper. Even more important, Armstrong points out, the show provided significant opportunity for women television writers to establish their careers in an industry in which they were noticeably absent. ArmstrongÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s absorbing cultural history offers the first in-depth look at a series that changed television.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e5320d370005cbd39887e6f12fd9d7d3af799e3","amp;dn":"Jennifer+Keishin+Armstrong+-+Mary+and+Lou+and+Rhoda+and+Ted+%5B96%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e5320d370005cbd39887e6f12fd9d7d3af799e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,83,32,211,112,0,92,189,57,136,126,111,18,253,157,125,58,247,153,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
