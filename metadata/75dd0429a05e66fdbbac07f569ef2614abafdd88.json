No longer restricted to the limits of the physical world, the war on terror has exploded onto the net. In an attempt to confront this new threat, an elite counter-terrorism and anti-crime unit was formed: Public Security\nSection 9.\n\nTwo years have passed since the team's commander, Major Motoko Kusanagi, resigned from her post. After a rash of mysterious suicides, Section 9 is forced to confront the Puppeteer, a dangerous hacker with unsurpassed skills.\n\nAs their investigation of this terrorist threat takes them deeper into the bowels of a potential government conspiracy, Section 9 once again crosses paths with the Major, but is her sudden reappearance more than a coincidence, or is she somehow connected to the Puppeteer?\n\nNo one is above suspicion in this action-packed continuation of Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex saga!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75dd0429a05e66fdbbac07f569ef2614abafdd88","amp;dn":"Ghost_in_the_Shell_S.A.C_Solid_State_Society_%5B1080p%2CBluRay%2Cx264%2C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75dd0429a05e66fdbbac07f569ef2614abafdd88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,221,4,41,160,94,102,253,187,172,7,245,105,239,38,20,171,175,221,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
