This is what I use.\nVLC player (free), mplayer (free) and KMplayer (free) are available as alternative for all platforms (operating systems) out there and have BUILT-IN codecs and MP4 capabilities. But, video quality is approx. 10-15% lower, blurrier at least on system I have.\nOne can try CCCP matroska codec pack, where ffdshow codec/filter packs and Haali splitter comes in one package and support MP4 playback - but extra caution is required during the install process.\nQuickTime of course, supports H264/AAC natively.\nMP4 is ISO 14496-1(H264 video &amp; AAC LC sound) .\nrecommended resolution for computers is 1024x768..\nPS3 + HDMI cable + newer TV have been reported as best combination.\nI am very proud on sound quality and hence I recommend use of stereo system and proper loudspeakers (connect Line Out of Soundcard or standalones with Line In of any Stereo rack).\nAnd please, do not watch it with a nose in the screen, take proper distance to the monitor or TV (as advised in TV manuals).\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ccd63dbace10947aa56ec3d74f0715e81da00d1","amp;dn":"Justified.S01E08.272p.HDTV.H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ccd63dbace10947aa56ec3d74f0715e81da00d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,205,99,219,172,225,9,71,170,86,236,61,116,240,113,94,129,218,0,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
