I. PudovkinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMotherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and Dziga VertovÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOne Sixth of the World.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nBut much of the citizenry preferred ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMiss Mend,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ a wild pastiche of American adventure serials directed by Fedor Ozep and Boris Barnet. Filled with car chases and kidnappings, fist fights and physical comedy, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMiss MendÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was released in three feature-length episodes and set a box office record (1.7 million spectators) for its time. The party-line critics, of course, despised it, decrying its ideological impurity and lowbrow appeal.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOne can only hope that ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Miss MendÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ will never be exported abroad,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ sniffed a writer for Kino-Front, and for a long time that hope was fulfilled. This was not the kind of Soviet film the left-leaning intelligentsia of New York and London wanted to see. Where were the noble peasants, the thrumming farm machinery, the virtuoso passages of dialectical montage?\n\nInstead, here was a story, its first half set in an imagined United States, about a plucky working girl, Miss Vivian Mend (Natalia Glan), who joins with a reporter (played by Barnet, who gave the character his own name), a photographer, Vogel (Vladimir Fogel) and a tubby office clerk, Tom Hopkins (Igor Ilyinsky, a popular comedian), to combat a secret organization of international capitalists. The principal villain, Chiche (Sergei Komarov), is a coldhearted mastermind who plans to destroy the new society of the Bolsheviks by means of electrical insulators filled with plague germs.\n\nEntertaining, sure, but for the ideologues, just more opium for the masses. Not until the 1980s did ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMiss MendÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ begin turning up regularly at cinÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mathÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨ques and festivals; not until now has it been released on home video. Largely derived from the original camera negative, it looks amazingly good in this edition from Flicker Alley; it is accompanied by a stirring orchestral score by Robert Israel.\n\nOn one level ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMiss MendÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is an early example of a movie about movies. Based on a novel called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMess-Mend, or Yankees in PetrogradÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ published by the Soviet author Marietta Shaginian under the consummately American pseudonym Jim Dollar, the film draws on Hollywood archetypes for many of its characters. Miss Mend, a typist for a cork factory (Rocfeller &amp; Company), is a Slavic Pearl White in pencil skirt and black stockings, radicalized when she witnesses a strike brutally repressed by her employers. Barnet (far too good looking to be either a journalist or a director) has the athletic grace and easy charm of a Douglas Fairbanks; and Tom, the comic relief, has Fatty ArbuckleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s appetites and infantile gestures (if not his aggressiveness).\n\nBut where the good guys are all American, the heavy seems to have stepped out of the other national cinema much admired in Russia at the time, that of Weimar Germany. KomarovÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Chiche, with his domed forehead and horn-rimmed glasses, seems at once to derive from Fritz LangÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Dr. Mabuse and Robert WeineÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Dr. Caligari, as do many of his actions. At one point he even rises from a coffin, like F. W. MurnauÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNosferatu.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The Weimar filmmakers seemed to enjoy swooning in voluptuous surrender before these supernaturally powerful figures, but the Soviets are unwilling to indulge such decadent pessimism: Chiche and his capitalist scheming can and must be defeated by representatives of the masses.\n\nMuch as George Lucas and Steven Spielberg would do in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRaiders of the Lost Ark,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Ozep and Barnet signal their attitude toward the material by overplaying it, adding layers of complications that strain credulity. A fine example is the chase for a purloined will that comes near the end of Part 1, which involves horses, cars, a motorcycle and a steam locomotive, all charging along in a swirl of expertly intercut strands of action.\n\nBut where Mr. Lucas and Mr. Spielberg drift into cartoonishness, Ozep and Barnet preserve a core of human reality. For all of the exaggeration of the action, the emotions seem real, and death still has its sting, striking at least one major character with a force and suddenness that abruptly brings the film back to earth.\n\nWhen the action shifts to Leningrad in the filmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s second half, the directors confront a fresh ideological problem: thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s no way these American heroes can be shown single-handedly rescuing the young Soviet state. Their solution is ingenious: They bring in the filmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s only fully developed Russian character, a street urchin who introduces Vogel the photographer to the joys of vodka and shows him how to survive on leftover sausage ends. And when the time comes to close in on Chiche, the Americans discover what they should have known all along, that the Soviet police have matters well in hand already.\n\nAfter ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMiss Mend,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Ozep and Barnet went their separate ways as filmmakers. Ozep made two fine expressionist dramas, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Yellow TicketÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (1928) and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Living CorpseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (1929), and then, as working conditions became more difficult in StalinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Soviet Union, he emigrated to the West, making films in Germany (including a brilliant adaptation of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Brothers KaramazovÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½), France and eventually Canada, where he made his two final films (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe FortressÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhispering CityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) in 1947.\n\nDrawn more to lighter subjects, Barnet survived StalinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s crackdowns by flying under the radar, and was able to create two genuine masterpieces in the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢30s, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOutskirtsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (1933, available on an Image DVD with his silent comedy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Girl With the HatboxÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) and the transcendently beautiful ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBy the Bluest of SeasÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (1936, unavailable in the United States although a budget disc is out in France). He continued to work regularly (though seldom at the height of his talent) through the early ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢60s, when he put an end to decades of disappointment by hanging himself in a hotel room.\n\nFor both men ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMiss MendÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ represented a moment of youthful exuberance and creative freedom that they would never experience again. Its characters may be American, but the joy that shines through it is that of the infant Soviet state, still toddling through its Utopian period when everything was new, and a world was waiting to be made. It was a moment that couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t and didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t last long; thanks to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMiss MendÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ we can still share it.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i783.photobucket.com/albums/yy116/muffy_kitteh/Clipboard01-30.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i783.photobucket.com/albums/yy116/muffy_kitteh/Clipboard01-30.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i783.photobucket.com/albums/yy116/muffy_kitteh/Clipboard02-29.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i783.photobucket.com/albums/yy116/muffy_kitteh/Clipboard02-29.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i783.photobucket.com/albums/yy116/muffy_kitteh/Clipboard03-31.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i783.photobucket.com/albums/yy116/muffy_kitteh/Clipboard03-31.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i783.photobucket.com/albums/yy116/muffy_kitteh/Clipboard04-31.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i783.photobucket.com/albums/yy116/muffy_kitteh/Clipboard04-31.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i783.photobucket.com/albums/yy116/muffy_kitteh/Clipboard05-27.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i783.photobucket.com/albums/yy116/muffy_kitteh/Clipboard05-27.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i783.photobucket.com/albums/yy116/muffy_kitteh/Clipboard06-18.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i783.photobucket.com/albums/yy116/muffy_kitteh/Clipboard06-18.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i783.photobucket.com/albums/yy116/muffy_kitteh/Clipboard07-3.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i783.photobucket.com/albums/yy116/muffy_kitteh/Clipboard07-3.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-------my rip-------\n\n~~~~~~ Part 1.avi ~~~~~~\n\nFile Size (in bytes):...........................1,171,220,480\n\n--- Video Information ---\nVideo Codec Name:...............................XviD ISO MPEG-4\nDuration (hh:mm:ss):............................1:28:15\nFrame Count:....................................95301\nFrame Width (pixels):...........................608\nFrame Height (pixels):..........................448\nAspect Ratio:...................................1.357\nFrames Per Second:..............................18.000\nVideo Bitrate (kbps):...........................1634\n......MPEG-4......B-VOP........................\nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:..............0.333&quot;\n\n--- Audio Information ---\nAudio Codec:....................................0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):.........................48000\nAudio Bitrate(kbps):............................128\nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):............CBR\nAudio Channel Count:............................2 \n\n********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
