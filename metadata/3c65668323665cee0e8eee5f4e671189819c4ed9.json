They've been subbed by Static Subs and Eclipse [Static Subs: http://www.staticsubs.org/] [Eclipse: http://eclipse.speedsubs.org/]. Download from those sources if you find this torrent is too slow, for after watching this series in its entirety, I'd be glad to at least point you in the right direction.\n\n--==--Video Format--==--\n\nI see comments a lot of the time for any torrent involving .mkv's, so to avoid the Comments being used on something that has long been solved over and over again, I'm telling you to view them in VLC Media Player [http://www.videolan.org/vlc/].\n\n--==--Why am I so desperate to get this out?--==--\n\nIt's an amazing series. It's touching, and very emotional, and definitely worth the download, wherever you decide to download it.\n\n--==--Alternative download places in case this one's too slow--==--\n\n=-BakaBT: [http://www.bakabt.com/146711-clannad-after-story-ss-eclipse.html] I'd actually suggest using this place over the Pirate Bay for Anime (would've saved me some time).\n\n=-Otherwise, if it's not here or on BakaBT, I'd suggest finding the guys that subbed the series (if it's subbed) and download from there, ie:\n\n-Eclipse Productions: [http://eclipse.speedsubs.org/projects/clannad]\n\n-Static Subs (atm, it's still getting revamped, email me when it's back to normal): [http://www.staticsubs.org/]\n\n--==--Contact--==--\n\nEmail any complaints at &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;43302b22272c346d372c2f03242e222a2f6d202c2e6d&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c65668323665cee0e8eee5f4e671189819c4ed9","amp;dn":"%5BSS-Eclipse%5D+Clannad+%7EAfter+Story%7E+%2B+Extra+%5BWideScreen%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c65668323665cee0e8eee5f4e671189819c4ed9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,101,102,131,35,102,92,238,14,142,238,95,78,103,17,137,129,156,78,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
