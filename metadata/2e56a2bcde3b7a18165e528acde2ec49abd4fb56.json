The Klingon Empire has been one of the Federation's deadliest enemies for nearly a century. All of that changes when their key energy production facility, the moon Praxis, explodes, damaging the Klingon home world's atmosphere and meaning that all ozone will be depleted in 50 years. Unable to the cope with this disaster due to their massive military expenditures, the Empire seeks peace talks with the Federation in order to receive aid. Kirk however is opposed to the peace talks; it has been eight years since his son David was killed at the Genesis planet and he has never been able to forgive the Klingons for it. But he is a Starfleet officer and must escort Kronos One, the ship carrying Klingon Chancellor Gorkon, to Earth. But while en route, Kronos One is fired upon and Gorkon is assassinated. All evidence points to the Enterprise-A as the source of the photon torpedoes and Kirk and McCoy as the assassins, who are subsequently arrested, tried, and sentenced to life at the gulag Rura Penthe. But Spock is certain that Kirk and the Enterprise-A have been framed and with the aid of senior staff as well as help from Sulu, now captain of the Excelsior, set out to clear Kirk's name and cement a lasting peace between the United Federation of Planets and the Klingon Empire before all is too late.\n\nRating: 7.2/10   23,108 votes\n\n\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n\nStar.Trek.VI.The.Undiscovered.Country.1991.PAL.DVDR.(2 Disc)-(Untouched)\n\n\n\n\nFormat                           : MPEG-PS\nOverall bit rate                 : 6 853 Kbps\n\nVideo\nID                               : 224 (0xE0)\nFormat                           : MPEG Video\nFormat version                   : Version 2\nFormat profile                   : Main@Main\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 5 489 Kbps\nNominal bit rate                 : 9 800 Kbps\nWidth                            : 720 pixels\nHeight                           : 576 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16/9\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\nStandard                         : PAL\nColorimetry                      : 4:2:0\nScan type                        : Progressive\nScan order                       : Top Field First\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.529\n\nAudio #1\nID                               : 128 (0x80)\nFormat                           : AC-3\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Coding 3\nDuration                         : 20mn 53s\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 448 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 6 channels\nChannel positions                : Front: L C R, Surround: L R, LFE\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nVideo delay                      : -656ms\n\nMenu                             : YES    \nFormat                           : DVD-Video\nRelease                          : Untouched(DVD9)-  Anamorphic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAUDIO: English, German\n\nSUBTITLE: Arabic, Bulgarian, Czech, Danish, German, English, Icelandic,\nHungarian, Dutch, Norwegian, Polish, Romanian, Finnish, Swedish, Turkish \n\n\n\n\n\n.........................\n\nVisit us at www.arenabg.com \n\n\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n                           Upped by  didomh   @   A R E N A B G .
