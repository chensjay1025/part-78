A conventional story but one around which Humberto Mauro (the strongest personality of the Brazilian cinema from 1920-40) creates his own special style: a refined visual sense of atmosphere and the countryside.\n\n\nSummary from IMDB:\n\nIn Rio de Janeiro, Gilberto (Celso GuimarÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â£es) is a talented artisan engaged of Marina (LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­dia Mattos), working in a pottery factory. He is hired by the millionaire widow Luciana (Carmem Santos) to perform a restoration in her castle in Correas, a district of PetrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³polis. He suffers an accident and Luciana lodges and treats him for a long period, and they fall in love for each other. The moral values of the Brazilian society of the 40's make this love impossible for them. &quot;Argila&quot; is a beautiful and sensitive romance. The direction of Humberto Mauro is excellent, but the story is very dated for the present days. It is very interesting to see the behavior of the society sixty-five years ago, and very worthwhile watching this very rare movie, which is difficult to be found in Brazil. My vote is seven.\n\nCast:\n\nCarmen Santos\t ... \tLuciana\nCelso GuimarÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â£es\t... \tGilberto\nLÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­dia Mattos\t... \tMarina\nFloriano Faissal\t... \tBarrocas\nSaint Clair Lopes\t... \tClaudio\nBandeira Duarte\t\t\nMauro de Oliveira\t\t\nJ.
