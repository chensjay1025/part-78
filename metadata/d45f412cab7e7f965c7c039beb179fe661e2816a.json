It explores what happens when a group of people try and change the world.\n\nFour young idealists have decided to form a new political party to save the world from itself. The new fifth member, Duncan, sets about saving the world from them.\n\nA suburban garden shed is the setting, as the adolescent adults debate forming their own political party. From the perils of electing a leader and choosing a party name through to the finer intricacies of Foreign and Environmental policy, this comedy satirises the ambitions, hypocrisy and naivety of those who choose to try to change the world.\n\nParty is about small minds tackling big issues - China, sex trafficking, cycle lanes, unfair trade coffee, whether to call the party 'The Friendly Party' or 'Gladios', and when, exactly, they should break to eat a cake.\n\n\n\nwww.comedy.co.uk Review: \n\nThis play has stormed Edinburgh (it won a Fringe First Award) and has been playing out in London to packed houses. The radio adaptation seems to have managed to capture much of the magic of the stage show as episode one has been favourably reviewed from all quarters too.\n\nCast:\nTom Basden\nTim Key\nJonny Sweet\nAnna Crilly\nKaty Wix\nNick Mohammed\n\nWritten by Tom Basden \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/radio/party/episodes/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/radio/party/episodes/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nParty - S01 - E01\nParty - S01 - E02 \nParty - S01 - E03 \nParty - S01 - E04 \n\n\n.\n\nAudio Format    : MP3\nDuration        : 28mn 1s\nBit rate mode   : Constant\nBit rate        : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)      : 2 channels\nSampling rate   : 44.1 KHz\nResolution      : 16 bits\n\n\n[b]A number of people are posting my torrents on other trackers.\nI have no problem with that - (Not much need as I already do this) - But a name check would be nice\nI was the one who spent weeks,months,years recording them[/b]\n\n.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d45f412cab7e7f965c7c039beb179fe661e2816a","amp;dn":"Party+-+S01+-+Audio+Comedy+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d45f412cab7e7f965c7c039beb179fe661e2816a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,95,65,44,171,126,127,150,92,124,3,155,235,23,159,230,97,226,129,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
