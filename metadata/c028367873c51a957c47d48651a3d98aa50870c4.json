I will make a rar file and name them with &quot;Husbehov Edit #X&quot; (X=The higher number, the latest version) so that you who already downloaded an earlier version of my Husbehov will be able to know which torrent you will download next time.\n\nAll songs are 320 kbps but I use Audacity to cut songs where I think they should start. That's why in the description it says 128 kbps. The quality doesn't get worse, it only says so in the description.\n\n\n\nThis edit contains following HOT tracks:\nBenny Benassi - Spaceship (Alex Gaudine &amp; Jason Rooney Remix) (Feat. Kelis &amp; APL &amp; Jean-Baptiste)\nDomino Dancing - You Are My Sunshine (Vato Gonzalez Dirty House Bootleg)\nDonkeyboy - Sometimes (Alex Sayz Remix)\nEdward Maya - Stereo Love (Paul &amp; Luke Remix) (&amp; Vika Jigulina)\nEric Prydz - Melo (Original Mix)\nFilip Le Frick - The Tangho (Mikael Weermets Remix)\nIdriss Chebak - Warm &amp; Oriental (Jonas Sellberg Remix)\nJerry Rekonius - Stars (Original Mix)\nJerry Ropero - Don't Lie (Sebastien Drums &amp; Rob Adans Remix) (&amp; Tom Novy Feat. Abigail Bailey)\nKaskade - Dynasty (Dada Life Remix) (Feat. Haley)\nKaskade - Dynasty (Kaskade Club Mix) (Feat. Haley)\nKim Fai - P.S (Original Mix)\nMr.President - Coco Jambo 2010 (Mick Kastenholt &amp; Alero Mix)\nPacific Wave - Pop Corn  (DJ Kharma Mix)\nTim Berg - Alcoholic (Mick Kastenholt Remix)\nUmek - Hablando (Original Mix) (Vs. Ramirez)\n\n\nAs you can see I have included a few oldies but who cares, the music is good!\nThe remix of Stereo Love that I have included in this edit is not new, I just wanted to share it because I believe it is the best remix of that song. Also, check out Mikael Weermets remix of The Tangho by Filip Le Frick. Not new either but it's a great song. Last but not least, Alex Sayz remix of Sometimes by Donkeyboy has amazing vocals and an awesome beat. check it out!\n\n\n\n\nStay tuned.\n\n\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c028367873c51a957c47d48651a3d98aa50870c4","amp;dn":"Husbehov+Edit+%235","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c028367873c51a957c47d48651a3d98aa50870c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,40,54,120,115,197,26,149,124,71,212,134,81,163,217,138,165,8,112,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
