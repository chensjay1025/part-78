It is bass heavy and deliberately crafted to have what some people call a &quot;lo-fi&quot; sound. Wackies achieved this sound using special recording techniques and equipment. This equipment was so notable that some pieces now have a place in the Les Paul Museum. Popular Jamaican reggae artists such as Horace Andy, Sugar Minott, and Wayne Jarret appeared regularly on the label. However, Lloyd Barnes developed a number of New York-based artists such as: Itopia; Chosen Brothers; Love Joys; Jah Batta; Clive Field Marshall; Dub Generals, and Junior Delahaye, whose releases primarily appeared on the Wackies label. Most commonly known as &quot;Bullwackie All Stars,&quot; Lloyd Barnes worked with a notable group of studio musicians including: Jerry Harris; Ras Menelik; Jerry Johnson; Clive &quot;Azul&quot; Hunt, and Douglas Levy.\n\nWackies music, while mainly known for its contribution to reggae, influenced the burgeoning hip hop movement of late-70's and Early-80's New York. Reggae sound system dances were quite popular throughout New York City. Wackies music was played on specialized, powerful soundsystems while reggae deejays such as Jah Batta vocalized rhythmically and melodically atop the trademark bass-heavy sound.\n\nThis is a self made comilation drawn from several releases on the Basic Label\n\nYou can see their catalogue here:\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://basicchannel.com/label/Wackies&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://basicchannel.com/label/Wackies&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTracklisting\n\n1.\tReckless Roots\n2.\tRock Ago Rock\n3.\tFeel It Dub\n4.\tPrepare Jah Man\n5.\tChin Chow\n6.\tRock Tune\n7.\tGenuine Dub\n8.\tFreedom Dub\n9.\tBetrayerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Call\n10.\tGem Rock Dub\n11.\tExplosure\n12.\tCreation\n13.\tAlways Dubbing\n14.\tDreadslock Rock\n15.\tSo We Dub It\n16.\tAddis Ababa \n17.\tThink It Over Dub\n18.\tUnder World Dub\n19.\tDub Full Of Girls\n20.\tSo Much Dub\n21.\tDubmatic\n22.\tCity Line\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0ffaae5580a3fa308022e4886ae2ce75737b144","amp;dn":"Bullwackie%5C%27s+All+Stars+In+Dub+Volume+Two","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0ffaae5580a3fa308022e4886ae2ce75737b144","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,255,170,229,88,10,63,163,8,2,46,72,134,174,44,231,87,55,177,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
