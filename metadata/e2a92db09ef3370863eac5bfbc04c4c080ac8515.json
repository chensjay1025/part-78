The album was ranked number 14 on The Village Voice's 2009 Pazz &amp; Jop critics' poll. In naming it the best album of the year, Jon Pareles of The New York Times discussed its musical significance to R&amp;B and soul music genres, writing:\n\n    MaxwellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fourth album defies current R&amp;B on all fronts. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s gentle and imploring, not cocky. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s elliptical, not blatant. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hand played, by a band complete with a horn section, rather than programmed. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s so improvisatory that melodies change from verse to verse. And even when the rhythm gets funky, the sad, lovely songs ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ about a crumbling romance ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ are suffused with a yearning thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s almost too intimate. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s soul music reinventing itself, moment to moment.\n    ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Jon Pareles\n\nAssociated Press named it the seventh best album of 2009. Billboard ranked it number nine on its list of the top ten albums of the year. The Boston Globe's Sarah Rodman named it the fifth best album of the year, and The Washington Post's Chris Richards ranked it number one on his list of 2009's best albums. The album also earned Maxwell two Grammy Awards, for Best R&amp;B Album and Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance (&quot;Pretty Wings&quot;), at the 52nd Grammy Awards in 2010.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2a92db09ef3370863eac5bfbc04c4c080ac8515","amp;dn":"Maxwell+-+Fistful+Of+Tears++%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2a92db09ef3370863eac5bfbc04c4c080ac8515","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,169,45,176,158,243,55,8,99,234,197,191,188,4,196,192,128,172,133,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
