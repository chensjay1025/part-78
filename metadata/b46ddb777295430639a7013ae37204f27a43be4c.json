Approximately 70,000 advance tickets were sold, but contemporary press estimates said that as many as 200,000 people attended. The festival was characterized by the widespread use and exchange of hard drugs. Local authorities chose not to intervene in the open drug use for fear of rioting.\n\nThere's not a lot music in this film. (Ten Years After, The Stooges, Mountain + some local Ann Arbor Bands) But it is a time capsule from 1970 &amp; the hippies. This was shot using an 8mm movie camera.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b46ddb777295430639a7013ae37204f27a43be4c","amp;dn":"Goose+Lake+International+Music+Festival","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b46ddb777295430639a7013ae37204f27a43be4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,109,219,119,114,149,67,6,57,167,1,58,227,114,4,242,122,67,190,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
