Frank BaumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s death. Although Baum was credited as the author, it was written entirely by Thompson.\nThe Scarecrow is upset when Professor Wogglebug tells him that he has no family, so he goes to where Dorothy Gale found him to trace his ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œroots.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Then he vanishes from the face of Oz.\nDorothy and the Cowardly Lion mount a search for their friend, but when that is successful, they will need to become a rescue party!\nRead by Mark F.
