Starter formed in 1981 as a three piece, led by Francis Foss, who remained the only original member after a personnel switch in 1985. \n\nStarter would release one LP in 1981, followed by several 12'' releases throughout the late eighties, calling it quits in 1989. Francis Foss was also active in Shy Rose, a Swiss Italo Disco act who released a handful of singles.\n\nIn 2004, Topfuel Entertainment collected Starter's discography and released it as an extremely limited CD-R pressing, sold alongside a DVD of various live performances over the years. Only sixty copies of this fine release exist, and I've had my eyes peeled for ages. Snap one up if you see it! Otherwise, here's the information for the CD-R portion.\n\n\n\nStarter- Start CD-R\n1. Lunapark \n2. Is This Love\n3. Minijupe \n4. Baby \n5. Plastic \n6. Tanger \n7. Tarzan And Jane \n8. Machinedrum \n9. Part Of You \n10. Victim \n11. My Love\n12. Night By Night \n13.
