The Space Shuttle Columbia Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first truly reusable manned spacecraft Ã¢â‚¬â€œ was lost during her return to Earth, along with a crew of seven. It was an event that, after the loss of Space Shuttle Challenger during a launch 17 years before, the world had hoped it would never see again. This book details each of ColumbiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 28 missions in turn, as told by scientists and researchers who developed and supported her many payloads, by the engineers who worked on her and by the astronauts who flew her. In doing so, it is intended to provide a fitting tribute to this most remarkable flying machine and those who perished on her last mission.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3ea037eb66cbc8a25b6898bf058c812040b3718","amp;dn":"Space+Shuttle+Columbia_+Her+Missions+and+Crews+-+Evans%2C+B+%5BNon-F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3ea037eb66cbc8a25b6898bf058c812040b3718","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,234,3,126,182,108,188,138,37,182,137,139,240,88,200,18,4,11,55,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
