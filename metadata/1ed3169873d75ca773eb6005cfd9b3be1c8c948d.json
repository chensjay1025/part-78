In India he witnesses a total solar eclipse - when the link to the light and heat that sustains us is cut off for a few precious minutes. But heat and light are not the only power of the sun over the solar system. In Norway, Brian watches the battle between the sun's wind and earth, as the night sky glows with the northern lights. Beyond earth, the solar wind continues, creating dazzling aurora on other planets. Brian makes contact with Voyager, a probe that has been travelling since its launch 30 years ago. Now 14 billion kilometres away, Voyager has just detected the solar wind is beginning to peter out. But even here we haven't reached the end of the sun's rule. Brian explains how its greatest power, gravity, reaches out for hundreds of billions of kilometres, where the lightest gravitational touch encircles our solar system in a mysterious cloud of comets.\n\nVideo Codec: h264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 9256 KB/s\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1:777\nVideo Resolution: 1440x1080 displayed at 1920x1080\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 384 Kb/s 48000Hz\nAudio Channels: 6\nRun-Time: 59mins\nFramerate: 50FPS\nNumber of Parts: 5\nPart Size: 3.85 GB\nSubtitles: merged\nSource: DVB-S\n\nThis is the original 1080 PAFF TS file wrapped inside a MKV container.\nYou'll also find the PDTV Xvid and 720p HDTV versions at MVGroup.\nThese 1080i files have been tested with VLC v1.0.5 and MPC-HC 1.3.1301.0 and FFDShow and Haali.\nIf you use FFDShow make sure you use the ffmpeg-mt h264 codec, not the default libavcodec codec.\nIf you use FFDShow libavcodec codec then one processor thread runs at 100%, the other runs at 0% causing jerky video.\nThe ffmpeg-mt h264 codec balances out the CPU thread usage.\nYou'll need a fast modern dual core processor to play these files.\n\nCPU Usage(E8200 2.6GHz): Thread1 Thread2 Average\nVLC v1.0.5.............:   25%     35%     30%\nMPC-HC v1.3.1301.0.....:   30%     60%     45%\n\nforums[dot]mvgroup[dot]org\n\nRelease schedule for 1080i\nPart 1: This is it.\nPart 2: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5494870\nPart 3: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5497916\nPart 4: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5501480\nPart 5: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5504057\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ed3169873d75ca773eb6005cfd9b3be1c8c948d","amp;dn":"BBC+Wonders+of+the+Solar+System+1of5+1080i+HDTV+h264+AC3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ed3169873d75ca773eb6005cfd9b3be1c8c948d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,211,22,152,115,215,92,167,115,235,96,5,207,217,179,190,28,140,148,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
