Their song, &quot;If I Came Back as a Song&quot; was voted 3rd place winner by a notable panel of judges inlcuding Tom Waits, in 2007's International Song-Writing Competition. \nThey recently returned from a month-long European tour to promote their first full length album, &quot;Wake the Hero.&quot; Fronted by Nathan and Rebecca Bliss, Brooklyn-based Barnaby Bright combines beautiful acoustic guitars, lush harmonies, rich string arrangements, quirky instruments and subtle electronic tweaks. Their unique brand of lush, indie folk is a warm and welcome wind of change. \n\n&quot;RebeccaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s smooth, melodic vocals are reminiscent of Karen Carpenter or Shelby Flint...and NathanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s incorporation of his jazz background into Garfunkel-y acoustic compositions bring diverse styles together to the folk in the road: a marriage of minds and hands and music.&quot; \n-The Deli Magazine \n\n&quot;Nathan and Rebecca Bliss make up the sweetly melodic folk-ish duo Barnaby Bright, whose songs have soundtracked heavy emotional moments on Days of Our Lives and ER&quot;\n-Time Out New York \n\n\n-----------------------------\n\nAfter not seeing a torrent for this, I decided to make one for their debut album, &quot;Wake the Hero.&quot; The band is fairly obscure right now, but hopefully torrents will change that. If you enjoy their songs, spread them around! \n\nAs always, since this is a new torrent, try to seed at least until it's stable. I'll try to do the same. Thanks! :)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59157bac7571a599755f4211f40a1c3489216f72","amp;dn":"Barnaby+Bright+Debut+Album+-+Wake+the+Hero+-+2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59157bac7571a599755f4211f40a1c3489216f72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,21,123,172,117,113,165,153,117,95,66,17,244,10,28,52,137,33,111,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
