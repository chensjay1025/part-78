Set the system variable: PKG_CONFIG_PATH to %GTK_BASEPATH%libpkgconfig\n11. Compile XreaL:\n\t&gt;scons arch=win32-mingw\n\n\nCOMPILING ON GNU/LINUX\n======================\n\nYou need the following dependencies in order to compile XreaL with all features:\n\n * SDL &gt;= 1.2\n * FreeType &gt;= 2.3.5\n * OpenAL &gt;= 0.0.8 (if compiled with scons openal=1)\n * libcURL &gt;= 7.15.5 (if compiled with scons curl=1)\n * GTK+ &gt;= 2.4.0 (if compiled with scons mapping=1, requires glib, atk, pango, iconv, etc)\n * gtkglext &gt;= 1.0.0 (if compiled with scons mapping=1)\n * libxml2 &gt;= 2.0.0 (if compiled with scons mapping=1)\n * zlib &gt;= 1.2.0 (if compiled with scons mapping=1)\n\nCompile XreaL for x86 processers:\n\t&gt;scons arch=linux-i386\nCompile XreaL for x86_64 processers:\n\t&gt;scons arch=linux-x86_64\n\nType scons -h for more compile options.\n\n\nCOMPILING ON MAC OS X\n=====================\n\nNOTE: OUTDATED\n\nMake sure you have libcURL and the SDL framework installed.\n\nDownload http://oss.sgi.com/projects/ogl-sample/ABI/glext.h\n\tand copy it to XreaL/code/renderer\n\nUse the included XCode project to compile XreaL and friends for both PPC &amp; Intel Macs.\nThe XCode project is located here:\n\t&gt;code/unix/MacSupport/XreaL.xcodeprj\n\n\nUSING HTTP/FTP DOWNLOAD SUPPORT (SERVER)\n========================================\n\nYou can enable redirected downloads on your server by using the 'sets'\ncommand to put the sv_dlURL cvar into your SERVERINFO string and\nensure sv_allowDownloads is set to 1.\n \nsv_dlURL is the base of the URL that contains your custom .pk3 files\nthe client will append both fs_game and the filename to the end of\nthis value.  For example, if you have sv_dlURL set to\n&quot;http://xreal.sourceforge.net/&quot;, fs_game is &quot;base&quot;, and the client is\nmissing &quot;test.pk3&quot;, it will attempt to download from the URL\n&quot;http://xreal.sourceforge.net/base/test.pk3&quot;\n\nsv_allowDownload's value is now a bitmask made up of the following\nflags:\n    1 - ENABLE\n    2 - do not use HTTP/FTP downloads\n    4 - do not use UDP downloads\n    8 - do not ask the client to disconnect when using HTTP/FTP\n\nServer operators who are concerned about potential &quot;leeching&quot; from their\nHTTP servers from other XreaL servers can make use of the HTTP_REFERER\nthat XreaL sets which is &quot;XreaL://{SERVER_IP}:{SERVER_PORT}&quot;.  For,\nexample, Apache's mod_rewrite can restrict access based on HTTP_REFERER. \n\n\nUSING HTTP/FTP DOWNLOAD SUPPORT (CLIENT)\n========================================\n\nSimply setting cl_allowDownload to 1 will enable HTTP/FTP downloads on \nthe clients side assuming XreaL was compiled with USE_CURL=1.\nLike sv_allowDownload, cl_allowDownload also uses a bitmask value\nsupporting the following flags:\n    1 - ENABLE\n    2 - do not use HTTP/FTP downloads\n    4 - do not use UDP downloads\n\n\nMULTIUSER SUPPORT ON WINDOWS SYSTEMS\n====================================\n\n  On Windows, all user specific files such as autogenerated configuration,\n  demos, videos, screenshots, and autodownloaded pk3s are now saved in a\n  directory specific to the user who is running XreaL.\n\n  On NT-based systems such as Windows XP, this is usually a directory named:\n    &quot;C:Documents and Settings%USERNAME%Application DataXreaL&quot;\n\n  On Windows Vista, this would be:\n    &quot;C:Users%USERNAME%Application DataXreaL&quot;\n\n  Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows ME will use a directory like:\n    &quot;C:WindowsApplication DataXreaL&quot;\n  in single-user mode, or:\n    &quot;C:WindowsProfiles%USERNAME%Application DataXreaL&quot;\n  if multiple logins have been enabled.\n\n  You can revert to the old single-user behaviour by setting the fs_homepath\n  cvar to the directory where XreaL is installed.  For example:\n    xreal.exe +set fs_homepath &quot;c:xreal&quot;\n  Note that this cvar MUST be set as a command line parameter.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1d62fd292caa80cc27fbe9a78a9f3d7e2d1d303","amp;dn":"xreal","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1d62fd292caa80cc27fbe9a78a9f3d7e2d1d303","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,214,47,210,146,202,168,12,194,127,190,154,120,169,243,215,226,209,211,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
