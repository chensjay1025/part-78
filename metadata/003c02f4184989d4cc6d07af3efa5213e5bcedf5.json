YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re fucking kidding meÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) and, worse, pusillanimous parents who surrender to their massive, mewling offspring (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hey, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got to abuse your kidsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦a little bitÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½).\n\nTitusÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ reflective side holds up a funhouse mirror to the world, then the instructive but incensed drill sergeant in this uncommon comedian smashes that mirror across the skulls of the legions that pay to hear his hilarious hectoring.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“We just went though the worst decade since disco and how did we deal with it: We bitched on the Internet, got medical marijuana cards and played Grand Theft Auto,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he scolds with his usual biting blend of cynicism, sarcasm and realism.\n\nMore showman than shaman, Titus blusters for change, yes, but for comic effect really; itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s his job, after all. He harangues the left and right. He japes blacks and whites. He mocks racists (Ã¢â‚¬Å“If you can name six different NASCAR drivers and the erectile dysfunction drug that theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re sponsored by, you may have a problem that we have a black president,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ starts a trio of jokes that sounds like either a clever homage to Jeff Foxworthy or an inside joke meant to jab the Blue Collar Comic with the penchant for redneck humor) and fanatical activists. His dual intent: demystify and demythologize all sides. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The truth is the truth,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he declares, only half humorously. Ã¢â‚¬Å“WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re all brilliant and weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re all douche bags. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s how it works, man.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:003c02f4184989d4cc6d07af3efa5213e5bcedf5","amp;dn":"Neverlution+-+Christopher+Titus","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"003c02f4184989d4cc6d07af3efa5213e5bcedf5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,60,2,244,24,73,137,212,204,109,7,175,62,250,82,19,229,188,237,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
