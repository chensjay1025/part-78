The band experimented with a variety of sounds and genres, particularly grunge, funk and psychedelic rock. The band consisted of Scott Hunter with the vocals, Jesse Sprinkle as the drummer for the band, Aaron Sprinkle as guitarist, and Nick Barber on bass.\n\nWhile Poor Old Lu developed an extremely loyal following, it did not achieve wide popularity in Christian circles, due in part to its edgy sound and challenging lyrical content. The band addressed hypocritical televangelists, drug addiction, sexual guilt, domestic unrest and spiritual rebelliousness in its lyrics, topics generally considered taboo in Christian music.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe2fdcd7ceb7af97c917c69165926a4838f23a3a","amp;dn":"Poor+Old+Lu+-+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe2fdcd7ceb7af97c917c69165926a4838f23a3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,47,220,215,206,183,175,151,201,23,198,145,101,146,106,72,56,242,58,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
