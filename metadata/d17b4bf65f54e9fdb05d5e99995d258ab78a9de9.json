Instead of focusing on many simple, but specific materials, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m going to show you techniques you can use and combine to create infinite variations of old, aged, vintage, dirty, antique, industrial, etc materials.\n\nIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll show you specific techniques to quickly create:\n\n    Scratched edges\n    Chipped edges\n    Patina\n    Polished convex areas\n    Leaks\n    Splashes\n    Dirt\n    Dust\n    Moss\n    Fading colors\n    Ã¢â‚¬Â¦etc\n\nNone of these rely on painting custom maps on top of the UVs Ã¢â‚¬â€œ everything is done with some clever use of tileable textures, procedural maps and geometry specific masks generated right in 3Ds max. And the best thing is Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the materials are easily reusable for any other 3d object! (No need to make the new maps from scratch)\n\nOhÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ btw\nSince following this tutorial requires you to have a good understanding of the VRay material basics, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m including my Ã¢â‚¬Å“Creating VRay Materials Vol 1Ã¢â‚¬Â³ for free :)\n\nSo basically I will show you some theory behind this advanced material creation process, then IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll show you a bunch of quick techniques and finally IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll also create 5 distinct materials from scratch using these same techniques, just so you can see how to put it all together.\n\nAltogether itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about 4 hours and 15 miutes of videos packed with information.\nThe tutorial is fully narrated and obviously all the max files and textures are included.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d17b4bf65f54e9fdb05d5e99995d258ab78a9de9","amp;dn":"Viscorbel+-+Creating+Old+and+Dirty+V-Ray+Materials","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d17b4bf65f54e9fdb05d5e99995d258ab78a9de9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,123,75,246,95,84,233,253,176,93,94,153,153,93,37,138,183,138,157,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
