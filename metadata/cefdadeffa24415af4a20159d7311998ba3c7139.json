The quality is not as great as I wish, as it is an upload of a copy of the VHS tape, but it is the only one around. This one is in English with no subtitles!! The following is from Wikipedia:\n\nThe Seven-Per-Cent Solution is a 1974 novel by American writer Nicholas Meyer. The story was adapted for the screen in 1976 in a Universal Studios production, directed by Herbert Ross, scripted by Meyer and designed by James Bond veteran Ken Adam. The all-star cast featured Nicol Williamson as Holmes, Robert Duvall as Watson, Alan Arkin as Dr. Sigmund Freud, with Laurence Olivier as Moriarty, Charles Gray as Mycroft Holmes (the role he reprised in the Jeremy Brett TV series), Samantha Eggar as Mary Watson, Vanessa Redgrave as Lola Devereaux, Joel Grey as Lowenstein, and Jeremy Kemp as Baron von Leinsdorf and Williamson's then wife Jill Townsend playing his character's wife (Mrs. Holmes). The film was made at Pinewood Studios with location shooting in the UK and Austria (including the famous Austrian National Library); the tennis match/duel between Freud and von Leinsdorf was filmed on one of the historic real tennis courts at the Queen's Club in West Kensington, London.\n\n\nLength: 1:52:59\nSize: 482 mb\nSize: 1.05 GB\nFrame Size: 640x480\nFrame Rate: 29 frames/second\nData Rate: 39 kbs\nVideo Codec: XviD\nAudio Codec: MPGA\nAudio Bitrate: 128 kbs\nTotal Bitrate: 167kbs","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cefdadeffa24415af4a20159d7311998ba3c7139","amp;dn":"Sherlock+Holmes+and+the+Seven-Per-Cent+Solution%2C+VHSrip%2C+1976","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cefdadeffa24415af4a20159d7311998ba3c7139","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,253,173,239,250,36,65,90,244,162,1,89,215,49,25,152,186,60,113,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
