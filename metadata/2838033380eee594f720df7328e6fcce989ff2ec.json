I will continue to compile them and they\nwill ONLY be available for download at mindset.tumblr.com as zip files. \n\nMy apologies for any inconvenience this may cause, although I don't see\nhow it would. Torrents are kind of annoying, y'all, especially if your ISP\nthrottles (like mine does).\n\nOh, also, I don't know if there will be a playlist next month. Or the\nmonth after. Or the month after that. I have no idea. Might go on a\nhiatus. We'll see. Just keep checking mindset.tumblr.com at the end of the\nmonth, basically. Thanks for reading, bros!\n\n\n**************************************************************************\n\n\n\n`       CUT THE CRAP PLAYLIST - SERIOUSLY UNCRAP - MAY 2010        `\n     ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````\n\nThis month: Everything is new except for track 16.
