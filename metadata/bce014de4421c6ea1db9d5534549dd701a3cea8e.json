If you didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t, just let me put it this way: nobody comes out of an oil spill looking good. It wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t exactly a Winston Churchill ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œblood, sweat, and tearsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ speech. But then itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hard to give a truly inspirational speech about mopping up an ugly mess. At least ChurchillÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œwe shall fight on the beachesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ phrase would still have worked. But instead of repelling Nazi invaders, weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re stuck shoveling oily sand into garbage bags. Face it, no matter how necessary it is to scoop up globs of oil, it doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t feel like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œour finest hour.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nThe reviews were pretty negative. Frustration is building up under the surface like oil plumes. Things are going to get sticky when it hits the beach of approval ratings. To be fair, lefties wouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be happy unless Obama was powering the TV lights by pedaling a stationary bike while he was speakingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ and conservatives wouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be happy unless he started drilling right then and there on the White House lawn. Of course, even when a speech by Obama can rightly be criticized, conservatives will criticize it wrongly. Moments after a speech in which the President vowed ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWe will fight this spill with everything weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve got for as long as it takes,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Fox News ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œanalystÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Sarah Palin said ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œwe havenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t heard that stopping the leak is his top priority.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½  Maybe Sarah didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t actually listen to the speech. Maybe she doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t know the meaning of the word ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œpriority.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nIf the President fell a little short for once as an orator, at least he came through as a collection agent. Today BP has tentatively agreed to create a $20 billion fund to pay oil spill claims. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTentativelyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ means that the details have yet to be worked out. And it also means that IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m sure BP was far from enthusiastic about it. If the $20 billion estimate is anything like the estimates of the amount of oil actually spilling, expect it to double several times. The actual cost, that is, not the amount BP is willing to put out. The plan would give BP several years to deposit the full amount into the fund so it could better manage cash flow. I just hope theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re better at managing cash flow than they are at managing oil flow.
