The Pipe of the prophecy has fallen into the evil hands of the goblins, propelling the world into a whirlwind of disorder.

Meanwhile, the MasterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s rascal student Woochi (Kang Dong-won) tricks the king with the art of transformation and creates a fiasco, which makes the three Taoist wizards and Hwadam visit the Master.
