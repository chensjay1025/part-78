I suspect it's an old German release (I found it on a German Rythm 'n' Blues blog). Sadly, I can't. I've searched the web and there is no mention of this record at all.  \n\nFilled with terrific things like Tye Tongue Hanley doing &quot;You Got My Nose Wide Open&quot; and the wonderful Helen Humes doing &quot;Woojamacooja&quot;, the charming Honey Brown doing &quot;Rockin' and Jumpin'&quot; and The Killer himself in top form doing &quot;Lewis Boogie&quot;. Jack Turner gives &quot;Hound Dog&quot; the Bob Wills and The Texas Playboys meet Nashville treatment and it sounds great. Howlin' Wolf's &quot;All Night Boogie&quot; is a predatory juke-joint classic. Jimmie Logsdon doing &quot;I Wanna Be Mama'd&quot; is a great Hank Williams meets Bill Monroe toe-tapper. \n\n\nLittle Sylvia doing &quot;Drive, Daddy, Drive&quot; is pure sex on wheels. Muddy Waters doing &quot;Muddy Jumps One&quot; is a classic guitar-boogie instrumental that sounds like it was recorded in someone's kitchen (and none the worse for that).\n\nSpecial mention for The Carlisles, whose &quot;T'ain't Nice To Talk Like That&quot; had me grinning like an idiot.\n\n\nThis LP introduced me to the fantasic LaVern Baker and I'll be uploading a 1949-1954 compilation of hers that I found.\n\n\nI could go on but what's the point? Trust your Uncle @artpepper...there isn't a dud track on this album. A real find. Enjoy.\n\n\n\n\n1. Baby Face Leroy - Red Headed Woman\n2. Bob Jaxon ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Beach Party\n3.
