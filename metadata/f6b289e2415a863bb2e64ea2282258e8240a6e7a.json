On the plane, Kumar lights up his new bong, the air marshals think it's a bomb, and Harold and Kumar are arrested as terrorists and sent to Guantanamo Bay. Ordered to fellate a guard, they manage to escape, make their way to Florida, and head for Texas to find Kumar's ex-girlfriend's fiancÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©, the well-connected Colton, and get him to intercede with Washington on their behalf. Kumar still has a thing for Vanessa, the feds are in hot pursuit, and the legal weed of Amsterdam seems a long way away.\n\nGenre: Adventure, Comedy\n\nDirectors: Jon Hurwitz, Hayden Schlossberg\n\nCast: John Cho, Kal Penn, Rob Corddry, Neil Patrick Harris\n\nUser Rating: 6.8/10 40,902 votes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6b289e2415a863bb2e64ea2282258e8240a6e7a","amp;dn":"Harold+%26+Kumar+Escape+From+Guantanamo+Bay+-+NTSC+DVDR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6b289e2415a863bb2e64ea2282258e8240a6e7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,178,137,226,65,90,134,59,178,230,78,162,40,34,88,232,36,10,110,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
