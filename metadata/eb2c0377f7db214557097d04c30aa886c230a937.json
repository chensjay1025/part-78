As you can see in the logfile, EAC reports two suspicious positions. It doesn't matter which drive I am using, the error persists and the problem lies in the disc itself. The errors are inaudible, and since this CD is so rare I still wanted to share it here.\n\n   1. Opener (06.57)\n   2. Berlin (08.42)\n   3. Soul (07.00)\n   4. Joybird (07.17)\n   5. I sing this song (09.05)\n   6. Rainbows and speeding motorbikes (07.52) \n\nJohan Arrias, alto saxophone, baritone saxophone, voice, percussionj; Leo Svensson, cello, voice, percussion; Henrik Olsson, drums, percussion, voice, electric guitar, Wurlitzer. \n\nRecorded on 14/15 February 2000 at Soundscape Studios, Stockholm; produced by Mats Gustafsson.\n\nLabel: Crazy Wisdom (now defunct)\n\nDon't destroy good music! Use FLAC and EAC.\n\nHope you enjoy this release.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb2c0377f7db214557097d04c30aa886c230a937","amp;dn":"%5BEAC%2FFLAC%2FLOG%5D+Gul+3+-+Crazy+Wisdom+002+%5B2000%5D-loeffel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb2c0377f7db214557097d04c30aa886c230a937","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,44,3,119,247,219,33,69,87,9,125,4,195,10,168,134,194,48,169,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
