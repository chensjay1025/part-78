EllisonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s energetic blend \nof indie pop with straightforward rock is sure to deliver a powerful emotional punch to the indie pop scene. Their debut full \nlength CD Say Goodnight, Sleep Alone hit stores in August 2006 thanks to the faith and hard work of Carbon Copy Media, the record \nlabel started by J.T. Woodruff, lead singer of Hawthorne Heights.\n\nOn September 25th, 2007 a brand new song by Ellison called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLet Your Guard DownÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ mixed by famed producer David Bendeth was \nreleased on the Punk The Clock Vol. 3 compilation alongside JackÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Mannequin, The Almost, The Starting Line and more.\n\nEllison will release their sophomore release, Color Of Compassion, independent of any record company on June 3, 2008. \nEllison is already looking ahead to plans for a second release in 2008 and will continue to tour the country and share \ntheir passion for music with newfound fans.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2fedfe6106807c96eb8f94b48c4283c38c44932f","amp;dn":"ELLISON+-+Say+Goodnight%2C+Sleep+Alone+2006+Release+320kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2fedfe6106807c96eb8f94b48c4283c38c44932f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,237,254,97,6,128,124,150,235,143,148,180,140,66,131,195,140,68,147,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
