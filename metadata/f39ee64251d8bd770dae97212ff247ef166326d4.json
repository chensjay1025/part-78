Fabric-loversÃ¢â‚¬â€youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll agree with Amy Walsh and Janine Burke that sewing basic patterns with straight lines is just about the quickest and most satisfying way to get yourself to a finished quilt. Ten quilt projects include yardage and cutting requirements for multiple-sizes. Enjoy stress-free piecing, easy construction, and learn how to alter patterns for completely different looks by resizing the blocks, trying a different setting, or changing the color palette. With fun, no-fuss patterns like these, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re free to explore all kinds of exciting possibilities with different colors, fabrics, and layouts!\nAmy and Janine love the simplicity of quilts made only from squares and rectangles. They argue that &quot;when you make a quilt in which the piecing does not give you angst, you are free to explore many possibilities with color, different types of fabric and prints, different block sizes and layouts...&quot; In this book of 10 projects, they encourage readers to experiment with the designs and introduce variations that will make them unique. To assist, they've provided guidelines for choosing colours and fabrics as well as close-up photographs of several blocks from each quilt, made with very different fabrics or layouts from those used in their full-scale sample quilt. Guidelines and yardages are also provided to make each quilt in a variety of sizes, which is a boon to those of us who hate tackling arithmetic. The projects would be perfect for those occasions when you need to whip up a quilt quickly, when you have some fabrics that you're dying to turn into a quilt or when your mood suits stress-free piecing.\n\nCONTENTS\nIntroduction: The Case for Squares and Rectangles 4\nChoosing Fabrics 5\nColor: A Crash Course Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Assembling a Palette\nDesign Decisions 10\nCustomizing a Design Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Elements of DesignMaking Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Design Decisions\nPROJECTS\nBerry Patch 14\nEcho 19\nBamboo 24\nFast Lane 29\nAll the Above 34\nCornerstones 38\nSky Blue 42\nAround Town 47\nBalcony Seating 51\nSquare Dance 55\nQuiltmaking Basics 62\nOur Favorite Tools Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Fabric Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Seam Allowances\nPressing Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Constructing a Quilt Top\nFinishing Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Laundering Quilts\nFavorite Resources 70\nAbout the Authors 71","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f39ee64251d8bd770dae97212ff247ef166326d4","amp;dn":"In+Love+with+Squares+and+Rectangles+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f39ee64251d8bd770dae97212ff247ef166326d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,158,230,66,81,216,189,119,13,174,151,33,47,242,71,239,22,99,38,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
