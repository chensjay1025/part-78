We begin our coverage with the legendary Detroit-based radical organizer and philosopher Grace Lee Boggs, whoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s been involved with the civil rights, Black Power, labor, environmental justice, and feminist movements over the past seven decades.

As the home of General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler Detroit was once the manufacturing capital of the world but today the city and car industry at a crossroads. We speak to Bob King, the newly-elected president of the United Auto Workers. The UAW represents about 355,000 workers, down from 1.5 million thirty years ago.\n\n\n- Longtime Organizer and Former Automaker Richard Feldman on the Rise and Fall of the Auto Industry in Detroit\n\nTo talk more about the history of the auto industry I spoke with Richard Feldman last night.

He is a board member of the James and Grace Lee Boggs Center.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3b2a79f99bba9f3e2ca074e679bcde1fbe7fbc6","amp;dn":"Democracy+Now+-+22+jun+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3b2a79f99bba9f3e2ca074e679bcde1fbe7fbc6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,178,167,159,153,187,169,243,226,202,7,78,103,155,205,225,251,231,251,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
