Then there is an explosive examination of &quot;Pyrotherapy,&quot; an activity where people can relieve stress by blowing things up. Finally, Larry joins a &quot;Redneck Anthropologist&quot; (among others) to search for the legendary bloodsucking menace known as the &quot;Texas Chupacabra.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2691ff92c80836cae3417c44077ee37529c38573","amp;dn":"Only+in+America+with+Larry+the+Cable+Guy+S03E12+Larry+Sees+Dead+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2691ff92c80836cae3417c44077ee37529c38573","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,145,255,146,200,8,54,202,227,65,124,68,7,126,227,117,41,195,133,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
