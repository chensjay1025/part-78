When a trio of witches tells returning hero warrior Macbeth that he is fated to become King of Scotland, he attempts to forge his own destiny. Aided and encouraged by his wife, he embarks on a guilt-ridden reign of terror.\n\nNicol Williamson (Macbeth) and Jane Lapotaire (Lady Macbeth), both renowned Shakespearian actors, bring a tension and mood to the play rarely seen outside of major theatrical events. Their performances bear testament as to why Macbeth remains one of Shakespeare's most popular plays and this production has brought its magic to millions.\n\nFor more information, you can visit:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Television_Shakespeare#Macbeth&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Television_Shakespeare#Macbeth&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.leninimports.com/macbeth_dvd.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.leninimports.com/macbeth_dvd.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nimage\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/eu03x40d9/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/eu03x40d9/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nSeed, please!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fa4b10a1cceb9f0e4fbfe30c0ba30fdf4e18d47","amp;dn":"MACBETH+%281983%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fa4b10a1cceb9f0e4fbfe30c0ba30fdf4e18d47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,164,177,10,28,206,185,240,228,251,254,48,192,186,48,253,244,225,141,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
