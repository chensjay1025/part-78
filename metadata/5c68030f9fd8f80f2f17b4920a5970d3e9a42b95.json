There are a lot of integrated components in this RockSteady Edition. It includes all updates upto June 2010, some additional programs like Firefox, Wireshark, Java are also included and there is a heap of drivers.. \n\nUnlike the RockStable Editions we have released, the RockSteady Editions are build to be feature rich. RockStable Editions are build as specified by M$ without using any tools like nlite. RockSteady Editions are build using Nlite, DriverPacks BASE etc.\n\nRocksTeam's Windows 2003 RockSteady Series have a Windows 2003 Enterprise Server Core. So it supports upto 32 GB of RAM which is more than enough for today's usage.\n\nThe problem with our (RocksTeam's) RockSteady Series is the more installation time needed for the updates and drivers integrated into it. But this means that you won't need to install much drivers after installation - it will install almost all drivers during the installation - also it should be able to recognize almost any new hardware that you will put after installation..\n\nAlso like any modified Windows running around, you can find errors during repairing or upgrading an existing OS. Also you can't use this as an image for Remote Installation Services. For these purposes use RocksTeam's RockStable Edition..\n\nTo Install this OS, burn the &quot;RocksTeam-Win2003-x86-RockSteady-2010-06.iso&quot; image into a DVD and boot from it.\n\n[b]CD-Key: J797T-WJPRH-KFKWV-HXKR9-FQGBB[/b]\n\n[b]Why not use a Windows 2003 Server as a Desktop/Gaming OS? [/b]\n\nThere are even rumors that Xbox uses Server 2003 Code in its OS. And many people have found out that Windows 2003 is pretty good in gaming.\n\nHowever if you are using Windows 2003 Server (any Windows 2003 Server) as a Desktop/Client/Gaming OS, you will need to enable/change certain services and features.\n\nIn Server - Sound, themes etc are disabled and Hardware Acceleration is also not enabled. \n\nTo enable themes, go to Start - Programs - Administrative Tools - Services - Themes\nRight Click Themes - Properties\nIn Startup Type - select Automatic - Click Apply\n\n[URL=http://www.imgbox.cc/viewer.php?file=94766006160966649703.jpg][IMG]http://www.imgbox.cc/images/94766006160966649703_thumb.jpg[/img][/URL]\n\nThen click - Start - this will start the theme service.\n\n[URL=http://www.imgbox.cc/viewer.php?file=45505544244009652369.jpg][IMG]http://www.imgbox.cc/images/45505544244009652369_thumb.jpg[/img][/URL]\n\n\nNow you can see that you can get Windows XP Themes in Windows 2003.\n\n[URL=http://www.imgbox.cc/viewer.php?file=64826534238799237022.jpg][IMG]http://www.imgbox.cc/images/64826534238799237022_thumb.jpg[/img][/URL]\n\nIf you want I have another theme for you- download it and extract the contents to C:WINDOWSResourcesThemes (%systemroot%ResourcesThemes) \n\n[URL=http://www.imgbox.cc/viewer.php?file=52617066682151350554.jpg][IMG]http://www.imgbox.cc/images/52617066682151350554_thumb.jpg[/img][/URL]\n\nNow to enable sound, go to Start - Programs - Administrative Tools - Services - Windows Audio\n\n[URL=http://www.imgbox.cc/viewer.php?file=21900422512107269670.jpg][IMG]http://www.imgbox.cc/images/21900422512107269670_thumb.jpg[/img][/URL]\n\nRight Click Themes - Properties\nIn Startup Type - select Automatic - Click Apply\n\n[URL=http://www.imgbox.cc/viewer.php?file=93818823010164659549.jpg][IMG]http://www.imgbox.cc/images/93818823010164659549_thumb.jpg[/img][/URL]\n\nThen click - Start - this will start the Windows Audio service.\n\n[URL=http://www.imgbox.cc/viewer.php?file=31590114269582575285.jpg][IMG]http://www.imgbox.cc/images/31590114269582575285_thumb.jpg[/img][/URL]\n\nFor enabling graphics acceleration,\n\nRight Click Desktop - properties - Settings - Advanced - Troubleshoot - Here Set Hardware Acceleration to Full..\n\nor go to Control Panel - Display - Settings - Advanced - Troubleshoot - Here Set Hardware Acceleration to Full..\n\n[URL=http://www.imgbox.cc/viewer.php?file=33837481732721600271.jpg][IMG]http://www.imgbox.cc/images/33837481732721600271_thumb.jpg[/img][/URL]\n\nFor enabling Sound acceleration,\n\nGo to Control Panel - Sounds and Audio Devices - Audio - Sound Playback - Advanced - Performance - Here Set Hardware Acceleration to Full..\n\n[URL=http://www.imgbox.cc/viewer.php?file=92263863423658541387.jpg][IMG]http://www.imgbox.cc/images/92263863423658541387_thumb.jpg[/img][/URL]\n\nNote that Windows 2003 Server by default provides more preference to background services rather than the foreground programs.
