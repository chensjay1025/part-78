He also presented highlights of his  research regarding NASA UFO footage. \n\nSereda refuted NASA's contention that objects seen outside the Shuttle are  &quot;space junk,&quot; saying that the UFOs captured on video (such as one he  described as looking like a &quot;golden mean rectangle&quot;) are much further away  than debris which would appear smaller. He also agreed with the notion that  NASA has a dual space program, and cited reports of &quot;giant triangles&quot; seen  east of Riverside County, which he said may be made by Lockheed Martin. \n\nThe germination for his new book Singularity came from a visitation he said  he received from a &quot;powerful being of light&quot; in 1994, in which he was given a  set of teachings that he later cross referenced in current science and  ancient texts. Humanity suffers from three forms of inertia brought on by  duality, but by experiencing singularity or oneness, we can surmount these  limitations and begin interstellar travel, he outlined. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9afeb8de148177bb1765c43ac53e56bf71b80c7","amp;dn":"Coast+To+Coast+Am+-+09-27-06+-+David+Sereda+-+Singularity+%26+Ufo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9afeb8de148177bb1765c43ac53e56bf71b80c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,175,235,141,225,72,23,123,177,118,92,67,172,83,229,107,247,27,128,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
