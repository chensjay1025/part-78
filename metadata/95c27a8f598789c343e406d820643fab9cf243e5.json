Some have a          \n    beating geological heart, others are frozen in time.     \n    Brian travels to the tallest mountain on earth, the       \n    volcano Mauna Kea on Hawaii, to show how something as      \n    basic as a planet's size can make the difference          \n    between life and death. Even on the summit of this       \n    volcano, Brian would stand in the shade of the tallest    \n    mountain in the solar system, an extinct volcano on        \n    Mars called Olympus Mons, which rises up 27 km.           \n                                                             \n    Yet the fifth wonder in the series isn't on a planet at   \n    all. It's on a tiny moon of Jupiter. The discoveries       \n    made on Io have been astonishing. This fragment of rock   \n    should be cold and dead, yet, with the volcanic          \n    landscape of eastern Ethiopia as a backdrop, Brian        \n    reveals why Io is home to extraordinary lakes of lava      \n    and giant volcanic plumes that erupt 500 km into the      \n    sky.                                                     \n      \n\n      \n            .  . ..: RiPPER/RELEASE NOTES :.. .  .           \n                                                              \n                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                             \n                                                              \n                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                             \n      \n\n                                             \n                  ..: GROUP NEWS/CONTACT :..  \n                                                           \n                                                      \n       SFM is dedicated to bringing you high quality     \n      TVRips and DVDRips of popular series and movies for   \n                     your viewing pleasure!                 \n                                                           \n       We are currently looking for:                       \n       - 100+ Mbit EU dump site for exclusive SFM usage   \n       - HDTV/PDTV cappers                                \n       - Crates &amp; Kegs of Beer (full of course)          \n                                                         \n                  .  . ..: GREETZ :.. .  .","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95c27a8f598789c343e406d820643fab9cf243e5","amp;dn":"Wonders.Of.The.Solar.System.S01E04.720p.HDTV.x264-SFM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95c27a8f598789c343e406d820643fab9cf243e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,194,122,143,89,135,137,195,67,228,6,216,32,100,63,171,156,242,67,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
