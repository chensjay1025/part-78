Times cover-up of 'Looting for Trayvon' flashmob riots where teens wearing hoodies smashed storefront windows, destroyed property and assaulted passersby in Hollywood while yelling, &quot;LetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s go mess up Hollywood for Trayvon,&quot; as the media outfit claimed riots were unrelated to the Zimmerman verdict. \n\nDavid also reports on the release of new photos showing accused Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokar Tsarnaev emerging from his boat hideout with not a throat wound to be seen. \n\nOn today's show, Alex Jones will also be popping in to discuss the TSA's launch of an invasive and audacious new procedure of conducting unwarranted searches on cars in airport parking lots. \n\nDavid also invites Lord Christopher Monckton to explain the UK's Independence Party's great strides towards becoming extremely viable candidates in next year's European Parliament elections. He'll also analyze Obama's future climate change initiatives and the greasing of the skids to pursue climate change legislation and initiate carbon taxes.\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential \n to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a\n spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the &quot;big \n picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media \n for news and info is a prescription for ignorance.
