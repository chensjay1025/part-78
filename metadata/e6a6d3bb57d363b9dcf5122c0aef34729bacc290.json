One day however, he wakes up to find himself in a parallel universe where he is married to Leslie and has two children: Ned and Maxine.\n\nRobin discovers that the version of Robin in this universe is a horrible man - a cad, a womanizer, a swindler and possibly even a murderer. The only person who believes that he comes from a different universe is his 'son' Ned, because he reads comic books set in parallel universes.\n\nWhile Robin tries to deal with adjusting to married life, he must also come to terms with the other differences in this new universe: he is living in a world where the North-East of England is economically prosperous while his home county of Surrey is depressed; Tony Blair is the leader of Conservative party but the power is in the hands of the Lib Dems; and a world in which Arthur Smith is a children's entertainer.\n\n\n\nCast:\nHugh Bonneville\nJosie Lawrence\nStephen Frost\nSam Bradley\nAnn Gosling\nArthur Smith\nBarbara Murray\n\n\nMarried - S01 - E01\nMarried - S01 - E02\nMarried - S01 - E03\nMarried - S01 - E04\nMarried - S01 - E05\nMarried - S01 - E06\n\nMarried - S02 - E01 - Churlish\nMarried - S02 - E02 - The Truth Is Out There\nMarried - S02 - E03 - Betrayal\nMarried - S02 - E04 - Identity\nMarried - S02 - E05 - Serenity\nMarried - S02 - E06 - War Of The Worlds\n\nMarried - S03 - E01\nMarried - S03 - E02\nMarried - S03 - E03\nMarried - S03 - E04\nMarried - S03 - E05\nMarried - S03 - E06\n\n\nAudio Format : MP3\nDuration Approx : 28mn 0s\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nResolution : 16 bits\n\n\n[\n\n\n\n[b]\nA number of people are posting my torrents on other trackers.\nI have no problem with that - (Not much need as I already do this) - But a name check would be nice\nI was the one who spent weeks,months,years recording them.\n\nThere is little point in downloading a &quot;Torrent&quot; and then recreating a &quot;Torrent&quot; using the same files.\n\nThe fact there was a torrent for you to download is clear you don't need to use the files to make another exactly the same version,\n\nAll you will do is split seeders over 2 torrents with the &quot;same&quot; files and make both have less seeders.\n\n\n\n[/b]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6a6d3bb57d363b9dcf5122c0aef34729bacc290","amp;dn":"Married+-+S01+to+03+-+Audio+Comedy+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6a6d3bb57d363b9dcf5122c0aef34729bacc290","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,166,211,187,87,211,99,185,220,245,18,44,10,239,52,114,155,172,194,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
