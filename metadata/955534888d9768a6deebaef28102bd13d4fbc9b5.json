This autumn, however, the pupils are overcome by a strangely overwhelming rowdiness, leading them to come up with increasingly more outrageous pranks. The school welcomes a new teacher, Father Weigl. The new, young teacher is aghast at his colleaguesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ liberal approach to the excessively bad behavior of the teenage pupils. Father ZoltÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡n, the form master of the 7th year students, pays less and less attention to the events taking place right around him. His younger brother was aboard the Titanic, which collided with an iceberg, and the official report on the injured and casualties is yet to be released.\n\n1h 33m 34s\nXviD 905kbps 624x352 AR1.77 25.00FPS\nHungarian MPEG Layer 3 128kbps 48000Hz Stereo\nEnglish &amp; Hungarian subtitles\n\ncredit LAP &amp; to all the people who made it possible for me to share this with everyone\n\nUPLOAD DEDICATED TO redchaos2354, Motley Crue, jdpennington, BADASS, W1ck3d1nt3ntz, ceo54, DaRkReAlM, ghostman, karakurachow, megaplay, Emery1337x, SaM, geordieboy1979, timamirrockdude, Noir, Shedevil, bone111, JorgeMontana, BlueLady, xxxUniversalAbsurdityxxx, mc68, TheFalcon007, pardeep333, X, DR67, DiNGiE, xclusive666, pro2kon, EMUworld &amp; many, many more &amp; to all the awesome people who are sharing (ALL THE UPLOADERS, THE RIPPERS, THE SCENE GROUPS, ETC, THE WHOLE P2P COMMUNITY)***wish i could list everyone***Thank you very much everyone &amp; i mean EVERYONE!!!\n\n*****help what we can with haiti or any other in need...the world is ONE big family*****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:955534888d9768a6deebaef28102bd13d4fbc9b5","amp;dn":"Prank.%28Tr%C3%83%C2%A9fa%29.2009.DVDRip.XviD-LAP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"955534888d9768a6deebaef28102bd13d4fbc9b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,85,52,136,141,151,104,166,222,235,174,242,129,2,189,19,212,251,201,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
