Are we getting the entire story from the media?\n\nAlso on the table is Arizona governor Jan BrewerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s defense of  her decision to enact the controversial immigration law.  She says the tough new law is the only way to prevent illegal immigrants from entering Arizona, but critics claim it is little more than legalized racial profiling.\n\nAnd BP is making a final attempt to capture the gushing oil.  TodayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s plan involves cutting the riser pipe to position a cap over the broken pipe.  If successful the cap will collect a large portion of the petrol volcano until the relief wells are completed in August.  If it fails, the volume of poison will increase by 20% . . . . for another two months.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd6b0669eaa776b47a4e702f33aaccf1d5d95412","amp;dn":"Mike+Malloy+Show+-+June+02+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd6b0669eaa776b47a4e702f33aaccf1d5d95412","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,107,6,105,234,167,118,180,122,78,112,47,51,170,204,241,213,217,84,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
