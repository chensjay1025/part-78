Just enter \n\nsome text to search on, press enter or click the search button and the list will \n\nfill with torrents found. Right clicking a torrent in the list will bring up a \n\nmenu to download the torrent and start your BitTorrent client.\n\nTorrent Harvester eliminates the need to use your web browser to check many \n\nTorrent sites if you are looking for a particular torrent. This means annoying \n\npop-ups, advertising, spyware and virus threats are eliminated. Torrent Harvester \n\nis also flexible enough to allow for the addition of new search engines, and \n\nalteration of existing engines in the case of site redesign.\n\nHere are some key features of &quot;Torrent Harvester&quot;:\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Easily searches a multitude of sites with a single click\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Returns all results in a single list\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Download directly from the list, or visit the website source page for complete \n\ndetails\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Complete filtering and sorting of results, on any column\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Automatically allows searching and downloading on sites which require user \n\nregistration, using your system's cookies\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Complete downloading transparency, with an engine status screen which shows a \n\ncomprehensive breakdown of exactly what pages Torrent Harvester is loading and the \n\nresults from each page\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Get updates of engines directly from within Torrent Harvester\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Create your own engines for your favourite sites using the in-built Engine \n\nDesigner, and create your own Torrent Harvester update website to distribute \n\nengines you create to other users\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Completely user-definable engines, allowing for creation of search engines for a \n\nmultitude of different sites: Torrents, IRC, ED2k, Cracks, Keygens, Direct \n\nDownloads, etc.\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Complete help every step of the way.\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· 88 Included engines, with more coming all the time via updates\n\nWhat's New in This Release: [ read full changelog ]\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Since the previous release, many engines no longer work due to the fact that the \n\nsites they are based have been either redesigned, or no longer exist. I won't list \n\nall the new, removed, or modified engines. A complete list of engines release with \n\nthis version can be seen on the Included Engines page. A few engines have been \n\nremoved due to the fact I am unable to test them without an account. Some sites \n\nare now invite only and I do not have the time to chase up invites. I'll leave it \n\nup to the users to create engines for these sites and post them or their update \n\nsites to the Torrent Harvester Support Forum\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Moved website toand created a new \n\nsupport forum at\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Created a Main Menu to allow for all the new options.\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Removed engines from settings and added to main screen via a toggle button \n\n&quot;status&quot;. Engines can now be selected/deselected from here. This screen now also \n\nserves as a progress/status screen which will show ...\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06c366f701bf6dc130813623b589659cfa4622d5","amp;dn":"TORRENT-HARVESTER+-FROM+88+ENGINES+TO+175+-Lindoff.RAR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06c366f701bf6dc130813623b589659cfa4622d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,195,102,247,1,191,109,193,48,129,54,35,181,137,101,156,250,70,34,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
