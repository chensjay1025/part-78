Slender: The Arrival uses similar mechanics to its predecessor, The Eight Pages. The character is armed only with a flashlight. This limited defense forces a sense of helplessness, as the best way to survive in the game is to run whenever in danger.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be189c6b8930ef1b11c7372f8f8522183babf200","amp;dn":"Slender%3A+The+Arrival+%5Bv+4.1.0.67110%5D+%282013%29+PC+ENG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be189c6b8930ef1b11c7372f8f8522183babf200","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,24,156,107,137,48,239,27,17,199,55,47,143,133,34,24,59,171,242,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
