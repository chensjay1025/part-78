In the beginning, we follow teenager Jodie (Linzey Cocker) as her dad takes her to spend Christmas with her estranged mother, Beth (Neve McIntosh). Relations are not good among the family, and Jodie would rather do anything else than visit her mother ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ an attitude which isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t helped when she arrives to find Beth having sex with a random guy, Kieran (Shaun Dooley, last known to horror fans as the violent father of Brett in shocker Eden Lake). Jodie storms off to stay at a local friendÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s home and Beth follows, attempting to apologise. At this point, the street is flooded with armed soldiers ordering everyone back indoors. When Asian neighbour Mr. Sharma appears from his house with a cleaver, covered in blood and screaming in Hindu, he is abruptly shot dead.\n\nFrom there, panic and paranoia set in as the housebound residents attempt to make sense of the situation. As is to be expected, the shipping container contained something secret, nasty and very, very dangerous; and everyone soon finds themselves struggling to survive amongst the bloodshed - and a military that may not actually be there to help them escape after all.\n\n\nPOSTER &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img121.imageshack.us/img121/5379/salvageposterb.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img121.imageshack.us/img121/5379/salvageposterb.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTRAILER &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.nme.com/movies/trailers/id/upbP3mYFyWU/search/movie&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.nme.com/movies/trailers/id/upbP3mYFyWU/search/movie&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nMovie run time: 1 Hour and 15 min.\n\n\n\n\n-No Subs\n-English DVD Rip\n-Video: Xvid\n-Audio: Mp3 Encoder\n-BitRate: 128kbps\n\nVIDEO:\n-Frame width: 624\n-Frame Height: 352\n-Data rate: 1220kbps\n-Frame rate: 29 frames/second","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69078484336def18ae880f334bd9e189f91eb405","amp;dn":"Salvage+%5B2010%5D+DVDRiP+JB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69078484336def18ae880f334bd9e189f91eb405","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,7,132,132,51,109,239,24,174,136,15,51,75,217,225,137,249,30,180,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
