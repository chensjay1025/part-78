Butch Trucks announced on Moogis that the &quot;New Instrumental&quot; had been named &quot;Bag End&quot; by Derek, possibly a reference to Frodo's house in Lord of the Rings.  This dreamy number definitely takes you there and back again! \n\nOther first set highlights include the slide showcase that begins with &quot;Ain't Wastin' Time No More&quot; and continues through &quot;Stand Back&quot; into &quot;Hoochie Coochie Man.&quot;  Derek is on fire during this sequence!  Warren takes the reigns on a funky &quot;Good Morning Little Schoolgirl,&quot; and the whole band is hittin' the note on a rare first set &quot;Whipping Post.&quot;\n\nThe second set opens with a magnificent combo of &quot;Little Martha&quot; and &quot;Blue Sky&quot; that is reminiscent of the 3/23/09 Beacon show.  Extended, exploratory versions of &quot;Dreams&quot; and &quot;No One To Run With&quot; show the band breaking new ground and finding new corners in familiar jams, just when you thought you had heard it all.\n\nBruce Katz of Gregg's solo band joins in for a wailing, bluesy &quot;The Sky Is Crying,&quot; and stays on board for an &quot;Elizabeth Reed&quot; that packs a powerful punch!  Bruce's keys give this version a mid-70's Chuck Leavell vibe, and Derek and Warren are going for broke on their solos.  A spirited &quot;One Way Out&quot; encore wraps up a great weekend at a new venue!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef5220ce72762676ee2a0dee46dc71f89429cd24","amp;dn":"The+Allman+Brothers+-+LIVE+03%2F13%2F2010+%5B320k+MP3%5D+NYC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef5220ce72762676ee2a0dee46dc71f89429cd24","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,82,32,206,114,118,38,118,238,42,13,238,70,220,113,248,148,41,205,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
