Only a few bold adventurers live them. Two such adventurers are Denis Belliveau and Francis O'Donnell, who took a wild idea - they wanted to retrace Marco Polo's entire 25,000 mile land-and-sea route from Venice to China and back - and spent two incredible years of their lives trying to turn it into reality. IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF MARCO POLO chronicles the extraordinary journey of two ordinary guys - Denis, at the time a wedding photographer, Francis an artist and U.S. Marine veteran -- as they venture on foot, on horseback, on camel-back, in jeeps and trucks and boats and trains, through Venice, Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, several former republics of the Soviet Union, China, Indonesia and India.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ecf8d3751f2e6891b33e5fa6b9f60fc467bea10","amp;dn":"In+The+Footsteps+of+Marco+Polo+%282008%29%2C+Web+Rip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ecf8d3751f2e6891b33e5fa6b9f60fc467bea10","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,207,141,55,81,242,230,137,27,51,229,250,107,159,96,252,70,123,234,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
