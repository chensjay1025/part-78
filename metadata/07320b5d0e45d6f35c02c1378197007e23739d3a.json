Warren \n \n\n\nAppearing during the second hour, Professor of Biology, Peter Ward, talked about the impact of BP's oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico. The estimates of how much is being leaked has varied depending on the source. &quot;It cannot have hit in a worse place,&quot; as we're dealing with a body of water that doesn't have a great deal of circulation on the bottom, he noted. The Gulf has already experienced 'Dead Zones,' where oxygen is removed from the water, and bottom life has been killed off. Thus, the oil can't be broken up and destroyed by bacteria that would otherwise be growing there, he explained. \n\nFurther, the Gulf area contains thousands of streams-- the oil will go up into those streams and sink into the mud, and there's no easy way to clean it, he warned, adding that with the increased rise of sea levels, the oil will be pushed inward. \n\nEcological biologist David Blume joined the program in the third hour, also discussing the oil catastrophe. There could be as much as 1 million gallons a day being spilled from BP's broken oil pipes, he detailed. Yet, current drilling practices aren't going to change, until, perhaps &quot;there's oil on the shores of the Potomac in Washington,&quot; and that is actually a possibility as the oil slick could be carried along the East Coast by the Gulf Stream, he said. \n\nBlume talked about alcohol gas as a cleaner and more plentiful alternative to oil, and how a wide network of small-scale alcohol fuel plants could be set up. Several states have requested to have higher percentages of alcohol added to their fuel but the EPA has been balking for political reasons, he suggested. \n\nTimes Square Terrorist\nIn the first hour, investigative journalist Peter Lance reported on the Times Square terrorist, Faisal Shahzad, and how the FBI has once again exhibited counter-intelligence failures in relation to terrorism. The FBI had been monitoring Shahzad going back to 2004, and should have been able to prevent the attack, he commented. \n\nHow to Experience Ghostly Phenomena\nLast hour guest, paranormal investigator Joshua P. Warren offered techniques in how to experience ghostly phenomena. Interestingly, he said increased levels of potassium in the body (such as by drinking a product like Gatorade) can make a person more electrically conductive, and possibly more attractive to spirits. Enhancing your energy field or becoming sensitive to energy fields (such as by holding your knuckles in front of a TV screen) is another way to attract or become aware of phenomena, he added. \n\n\nWebsite(s):\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢peterlance.com\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢alcoholcanbeagas.com\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢joshuapwarren.com\nBook(s):\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Triple Cross\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Cover Up: What the Government Is Still Hiding About the War on Terror\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Under a Green Sky: Global Warming, the Mass Extinctions of the Past, and What They Can Tell Us About Our Future\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Life as We Do Not Know It\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Alcohol Can Be a Gas!\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Pet Ghosts: Animal Encounters from Beyond the Grave","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07320b5d0e45d6f35c02c1378197007e23739d3a","amp;dn":"Coast+to+Coast+AM+-+05-06-10+-+Oil+Spill+%26+Energy+Alternatives","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07320b5d0e45d6f35c02c1378197007e23739d3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,50,11,93,14,69,214,243,92,2,193,55,129,151,0,126,35,115,157,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
