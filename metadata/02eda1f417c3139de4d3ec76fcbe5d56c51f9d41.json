Someone--probably a god--has trapped MaxÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s friend The Great Karlini in a castle that keeps trying to move at the most inconvenient times, and naturally itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s up to Max to figure out how to spring him. But the gods throwing their weight around in Roosing Oolvaya are more than Max bargained for, and soon heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s caught between necromancers, working with a detective named The Creeping Sword, and even dancing with Death itself in a desperate attempt to save the city from catastrophe.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02eda1f417c3139de4d3ec76fcbe5d56c51f9d41","amp;dn":"Spell+of+Catastrophe+by+Mayer+Alan+Brenner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02eda1f417c3139de4d3ec76fcbe5d56c51f9d41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,237,161,244,23,195,19,157,228,211,236,118,252,190,93,86,197,31,157,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
