The evidence is examined closely in forensic studies of what makes these rock 'n' roll types tick, starting with the lead singer. Often he's the leader, sometimes the dictator, benign or otherwise. His voice is his instrument and out front there's nowhere to hide. He hires. He fires. And when it all goes wrong and the backlash begins, he will get the blame. \n\nAn eye-opening romp through great war stories from the rock 'n' roll frontline explores the myriad ways of tackling the daunting role of front person. From the seemingly fearless, like taboo-shattering Jim Morrison of The Doors, to the mesmerically fragile, like Joy Division's ill-starred Ian Curtis. From Mick Jagger, who drew up the blueprint of front man as athlete, lothario and chairman of the board to the swaggeringly cantankerous yet strangely static force of nature that is Liam Gallagher.\n\nA starry cast list, including Iggy Pop, Roger Daltrey and Dave Grohl, considers how and why they do what they do on and off stage. Sting speculates where necessary confidence ends and arrogance begins, while Muse's Matt Bellamy wonders whether a tendency towards the diva-ish is an inevitable by-product of the pressures of being the band's focal point. Shaun Ryder of Happy Mondays recalls harsh lessons learnt from underestimating the tabloids, and Siouxsie Sioux revels in the moments when it all goes right.\n \nBroadcast on:BBC Two 11:05pm Saturday 1st May 2010\n\nDuration:60 minutes\n\nRipped by myself from BBCiPlayer, Protection &amp; Copyright removed!!\n\nEnjoy!!\n\nTam&amp;Carla\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab4b0ed2c732997a010f7f31fd64f063e4376394","amp;dn":"Im+in+a+Rock+n+Roll+Band+S01E01+-+The+Singer_+BBCiRip_Tam.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab4b0ed2c732997a010f7f31fd64f063e4376394","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,75,14,210,199,50,153,122,1,15,127,49,253,100,240,99,228,55,99,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
