From my 16mm print.\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nTarzan and the She-Devil is a 1953 film starring Lex Barker as Tarzan and Joyce MacKenzie as Jane. It also features Raymond Burr, Tom Conway and Monique van Vooren, who plays the &quot;She-Devil,&quot; a colorful name for a female villain. The movie was directed by Kurt Neumann. Tarzan is held captive during much of the movie, and critics derided it as lacking action. Tarzan and the She-Devil was Barker's fifth and final appearance as Edgar Rice Burroughs' ape-man. Barker, who had replaced Johnny Weismuller in the role of Tarzan, would be succeeded by Gordon Scott in the next jungle opus.\n\n Cast\nLex Barker ... Tarzan\nJoyce MacKenzie ...
