They initially were sponsored by the Holy Name parish and were called the Holy Name Cadets. The Holy Name parish would not sponsor the corps in the 1958 American Legion Finals so the corps competed as the Garfield Cadets. The name of the corps was changed officially to the Garfield Cadets as Holy Name parish ceased their relationship with the corps. Many years later, the corps' name changed to Cadets of Bergen County and eventually simply to The Cadets.\n\nThey hold several distinctions, being one of the few charter corps of DCI who have attended every championship held, being the only World Class (formerly Division I) corps to step off on the right foot, as well as being the second most successful corps in the DCI circuit with nine world champion titles over three decades. The Cadets have moved their headquarters from Bergen County, New Jersey, to Allentown, PA, where the DCI Eastern Classic is held. The corps is known for unique and risky moves, such as using vocals throughout an entire show.\n\n**********\n\nThis is the 1990 release of volume 2 of a two-volume, limited edition CD set of The Cadets performances during the 80's, all in high-quality FLAC format. Included are CD and case artwork, as well a CUE sheet for burning to CD and track extraction.\n\nPlease do not ask for volume 1, as I do not have it. If you have it and upload it here or elsewhere, please post the torrent link AND the magnet link below.\n\n***********\n\nTRACK LISTING AND PERFORMANCE NOTES\n\n* 1985 \tJeremiah Symphony / Overture to &quot;Candide&quot; / Make Our Garden Grow \n* 1986 \t&quot;On the Waterfront&quot; / Christopher Street (from &quot;Wonderful Town&quot;) \t\n* 1987 \t&quot;Appalachian Spring&quot; \t\n* 1988 \tThird Symphony (Aaron Copland) \n* 1989 \t&quot;Les MisÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©rables&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:871a28d5834164761850b27e770ce2a5742f3544","amp;dn":"The+Cadets%3A+Corps+of+the+80s+Volume+2+%281985+-+1989%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"871a28d5834164761850b27e770ce2a5742f3544","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,26,40,213,131,65,100,118,24,80,178,126,119,12,226,165,116,47,53,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
