Bowman emerged as an early public critic of the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI, also aka &quot;Star Wars&quot;) during the Ronald Reagan administration. In 2000, he campaigned nationwide for the nomination of the Reform Party of the United States of America for President of the United States. In some Reform Party straw polls, he polled better than the ultimate winner of the nomination Pat Buchanan.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_M._Bowman&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_M._Bowman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.thepatriots.us/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.thepatriots.us/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nAlex also covers the latest breaking news and takes a number of calls.\n\n\n[lengthy &quot;live commercial&quot; with EcoloBlue during several minutes of 2nd half of hour 1]\n\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance.
