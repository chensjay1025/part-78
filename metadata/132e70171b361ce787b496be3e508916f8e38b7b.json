It was written by Thucydides, an Athenian general who served in the war. It is widely considered a classic and regarded as one of the earliest scholarly works of history. The History is divided into eight books. These book divisions are the work of editors in later antiquity.\n\nW. R. Connor [...] describes Thucydides as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œan artist who responds to, selects and skillfully arranges his material, and develops its symbolic and emotional potential.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n(Summary from Wikipedia)\n\n\n\nAn M4B file is an audio file which can be bookmarked. This is the audio-book file type. These files can have chapter markers which can be skipped through as you would skip through files on a play list. They can have built in cover art and chapter images. They will remember where you left off each time you stop the file and come back to it . And variable speed settings on Ipods and a growing number of other mp3 players can be utilized by this file type. The ability to bookmark allows for as little as one large file instead of many small ones without the burden of fast forwarding to find your spot every time you resume listening or the fear of otherwise losing your place. The reduced number of files also makes browsing through your files to find your book and your place in it much less effort.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:132e70171b361ce787b496be3e508916f8e38b7b","amp;dn":"Librivox+M4B+Audiobook+-+History+of+the+Peloponnesian+War+by+Thu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"132e70171b361ce787b496be3e508916f8e38b7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,46,112,23,27,54,28,231,135,180,150,190,62,80,137,22,248,227,139,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
