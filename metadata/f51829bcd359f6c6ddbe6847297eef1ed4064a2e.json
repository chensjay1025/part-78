Were they ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œjust following ordersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ as some later declared? Or, did they break under the pressure of a vicious war in which the line between enemy soldier and civilian had been intentionally blurred? AMERICAN EXPERIENCE focuses on the 1968 My Lai massacre, its subsequent cover-up, and the heroic efforts of the soldiers who broke ranks to try to halt the atrocities, and then bring them to light.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f51829bcd359f6c6ddbe6847297eef1ed4064a2e","amp;dn":"My+Lai+Massacre-American+Experience-PBS-4-26-10","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f51829bcd359f6c6ddbe6847297eef1ed4064a2e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,24,41,188,211,89,246,198,221,190,104,71,41,126,239,30,212,6,74,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
