The goal was to create a sequel to one of the greatest albums of all time. I've arranged these songs in a way so that they make a good listen that is cohesive and also tells a narrative. I've also created a new matching album cover.\nEnjoy.\n\nCredit to veryape and weerez.com for making this release possible.\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1. Blast Off!\n2. You Won't Get With Me Tonight \n3. You Gave Your Love To Me Softly\n4. Superfriend\n5. I Just Threw Out The Love Of My Dreams\n6. Waiting On You\n7. Devotion\n8. Walt Disney\n9.
