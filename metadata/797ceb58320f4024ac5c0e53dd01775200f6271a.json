Famine, civil wars and rampant disease have left the continent without hope, but for the efforts of Western do-gooders. At first, they arrived with food, bibles and the magic of penicillin; more recently they have hosted rock concerts and sent plane loads of grain. And in the last decade of the 20th century they arrived and took babies home with them. First there was Angelina, then Madonna, and now...Pauly Shore! The film builds its comedy foundation on the international interest in Celebrity Adoptions, and the debate that surrounds these transactions on both sides of the Atlantic. Sometimes politically incorrect and never scared to tread on manicured toes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:797ceb58320f4024ac5c0e53dd01775200f6271a","amp;dn":"Adopted.2009.DVDRip.XviD-VoMiT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"797ceb58320f4024ac5c0e53dd01775200f6271a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,124,235,88,50,15,64,36,172,92,14,83,221,1,119,82,0,246,39,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
