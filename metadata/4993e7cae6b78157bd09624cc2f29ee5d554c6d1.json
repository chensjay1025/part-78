We have had great success with our relationship with the Stooges &amp; Iggy Pop as well as producing high quality box sets and albums by T.Rex, Steve Marriott and the MC5.\n\nOutside of Jungle Records, who have done a sterling job for Thunders fans - above and beyond the call of duty, and of course Warners ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“So AloneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ album, we will be looking at compiling a boxed set of unreleased material from 1975 onwards.  We will also be re-issuing and re-mastering certain albums that have been out of print for some time. Reels of tape have been located already!\n\nAs fans, we want the profile of Johnny Thunders to return to the rock n roll music and fragile acoustic performances that he delivered. \n\nWe promise to produce highly packaged product and will liaise with fans to ensure we deliver exactly what they (and we) want on CD, LP, 7ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and digitally. \n\nBeta Petrol now have an archive of amazing photos, many unseen. With the official merchandise company ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t mess with us ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ providing quality T shirts etc, we can at last provide quality Johnny Thunders goods and hopefully bury all the cheap and vile product that has escaped over the years.\n\nL.A.M.F\n\nCarlton P Sandercock\nEasy Action","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4993e7cae6b78157bd09624cc2f29ee5d554c6d1","amp;dn":"Johnny+Thunders+-+Mondo+Series+-+Vol.+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4993e7cae6b78157bd09624cc2f29ee5d554c6d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,147,231,202,230,183,129,87,189,9,98,76,194,242,158,229,213,84,198,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
