Denton -- a geologist certified by the American Institute Of Professional Geologists and a licensed Environmental Remediation Specialist.\n\nDenton addresses all aspects of the BP oil disaster in the Gulf without hype or sensationalism.  He authoritatively conveys a greater depth and breadth of information than any &quot;expert&quot; I have heard since this crisis began, yet does it without losing the listener in technical jargon.  If you are interested in what really happened, why it happened and what could happen next, you owe it to yourself to hear this hour and twenty-eight minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_torrents_info_PLEASE-READ.txt\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance.
