She has a wonderful new job but Daniel discovers that a dark haired Italian boy with a Jersey accent doesn't fit into the blond surfer crowd, especially when he tries to date one of their girl friends. Daniel manages to talk his way out of some fights but is finally cornered by several who belong to the same karate school. As Daniel is passing out from the beating he sees Miyagi, the elderly gardner leap into the fray and save him by outfighting a half dozen teenagers. Miyagi and Daniel find the real motivator behind the boys' violent attitude is the their karate teacher. Miyagi promises to teach Daniel to fight and arranges a fight at a karate contest some months off. When his training begins, Daniel can't understand what he is being shown. Miyagi seems more interested in having Daniel paint fences and wax cars than teaching him Karate.\n\n\nFormat : AVI\nFormat/Info : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size : 622 MiB\nDuration : 2h 1mn\nOverall bit rate : 714 Kbps\nWriting application : MEncoder SVN-r29352(20090610-gcc4.3.3)\nWriting library : MPlayer\n\nVideo\nFormat : avc1\nCodec ID : avc1\nDuration : 2h 1mn\nBit rate : 574 Kbps\nWidth : 480 pixels\nHeight : 360 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 4:3\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.133\nStream size : 500 MiB (80%)\n\nAudio\nID : 1\nFormat : MPEG Audio\nFormat version : Version 1\nFormat profile : Layer 3\nMode : Joint stereo\nFormat_Settings_ModeExtension : MS Stereo\nCodec ID : 55\nCodec ID/Hint : MP3\nDuration : 2h 1mn\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nStream size : 111 MiB (18%)\nAlignment : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration : 26 ms (0.65 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration : 522 ms\nWriting library : LAME3.98","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aaa24917d90e05fcd91d96e45c86d454ca02a3e6","amp;dn":"Karate+Kid+I%2C+The","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aaa24917d90e05fcd91d96e45c86d454ca02a3e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,162,73,23,217,14,5,252,217,29,150,228,92,134,212,84,202,2,163,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
