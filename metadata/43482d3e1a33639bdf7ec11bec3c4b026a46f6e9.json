While this\n\nis shown, it will load a copy of the parts of the registry that\n\nit is going to check, and perform the actual scanning. Depending\n\non how much information is in the registry and the speed of your\n\nCPU, this will take anywhere from about 2 to 30 minutes.\n\nIf you have many entries in your registry, there may be times\n\nwhen RegClean appears to have stopped working. In fact, RegClean\n\nmay appear completely halted whenever it is checking remote or\n\nremovable drives.\n\nOnce these progress meters are gone, you will be prompted for the\n\nnext\n\naction. You can do two things at this point:\n\n1. Exit RegClean.\n\n   Well, thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s kind of pointless, but you can do it. Just press\n\n   the Cancel button.\n\n2. Allow RegClean to fix errors that it found.\n\n   This will create an UNDO.REG file in the folder where RegClean\n\n   was run. The file will be titled &quot;Undo computer yyyymmdd\n\n   hhmmss.REG,&quot; where computer is the name of your machine, and\n\n   yyyymmdd is the date and hhmmss is the time.\n\n   After the file is saved, RegClean will remove these entries\n\n   from the registry. You will see a progress meter while it does\n\n   this. Sometimes, the progress meter may stop momentarily, but\n\n   it should resume after a few seconds. When the meter is gone,\n\n   RegClean is done. Press Exit to end RegClean.\n\nWHAT REGCLEAN DOES\n------------------\n\nRegClean analyzes Windows Registry keys stored in a common\n\nlocation in the Windows Registry. It finds keys that contain\n\nerroneous values, and after recording those entries in the\n\nUndo.Reg file, it removes them from the Windows Registry.\n\nWHAT REGCLEAN DOESN'T DO\n------------------------\n\nRegClean does not fix every known problem with the registry. It\n\ndoes not fix a &quot;corrupt&quot; registry; it only fixes problems with\n\nsome of the entries that are in a normal registry.\n\nIt is very possible that RegClean will not correct a problem that\n\nyou have encountered. RegClean will leave any entries in the\n\nregistry that it doesn't understand or could possibly be correct.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nFIXES FOR REGCLEAN 4.1a\n\n - ALWAYS REPORTS ERRORS\n\n   RegClean will now report that it has found all the errors that\n\n   it can correct. Usually, you must run RegClean twice the first\n\n   time to get it to this point. This is expected behavior for\n\n   RegClean.\n\n - CRASHES\n\n   RegClean should run correctly on these Intel-based operating\n\n   systems:\n   \n   Microsoft Windows NT 3.51 (with Service Pack 3)\n   Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 (all versions) and later\n   Microsoft Windows (all versions) and later\n\n\nSYMPTOMS\n--------\n\nTwo messages boxes appear. One box says:\n\n   &quot;REGCLEAN.EXE is linked to missing export OLEAUT32.DLL:421&quot;\n\nwhile the next message box says:\n\n   &quot;A device attached to the system is not correctly functioning&quot;\n\nRESOLUTION\n----------\n\nYou need to install the update to the OLE Automation system\n\nlibraries. These files are contained in the executable\n\nOADIST.EXE, which is included in the download. (NOTE: If you are\n\nusing Window NT 3.51, you must use OADIST2Z.EXE instead; read the\n\nKB article shown below.)\n\nAlternately, you can find these files either at:\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot; http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q164/5/29.asp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q164/5/29.asp&lt;/a&gt;\n\n -or-\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot; ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/Softlib/MSLFILES/oadist.exe&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/Softlib/MSLFILES/oadist.exe&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;a href=&quot; ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/Softlib/MSLFILES/oadist2z.exe&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/Softlib/MSLFILES/oadist2z.exe&lt;/a&gt;\n\nYou can use most web browsers to download this file from either\n\nlocation.\n\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nPROBLEM: IT DOESN'T SOLVE MY REGISTRY PROBLEMS\n\n -or-\n\nIT JUST CREATES MORE PROBLEMS\n\n\nRunning RegClean may, in a few cases, cause other problems, such\n\nas causing part of the Microsoft Network viewer to stop\n\nfunctioning, or causing other programs to stop functioning. If\n\nthis happens to you, simply Undo the changes RegClean made, by\n\ndouble-clicking on the last Undo.Reg file.\n\nThese types of problems are very rare, but it's a good idea to\n\nkeep your last Undo.Reg file for at least a few days or so.\n\nMicrosoft will continue improving RegClean to reduce the\n\nfrequency of problems like these.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nPROBLEM: CAN'T UNDO THE UNDO.REG FILE\n\n\nSYMPTOM\n-------\n\nWindows displays several error message boxes when you try to\n\ndouble-click the UNDO.REG file to undo the changes RegClean made.\n\nRESOLUTION\n----------\n\nThis problem is unrelated to RegClean. It's a problem with the\n\nAssociated Program for .REG files.\n\nTo correct this problem:\n\n1. Go to any Explorer window, click the View menu, and select\n   Options.\n\n2. In the Options dialog, select the File Types tab.\n\n3. Scroll down in the &quot;Registered file types:&quot; list until you\n\n   find the entry called &quot;Registration Entries.&quot;\n\n4. Double-click this item or click on the Edit button.\n\n5. In the Edit File Type dialog, select the &quot;Merge&quot; entry, and\n\n   either double-click this item or click on the Edit button.\n\n6. In the &quot;Editing action for type: Registration Entries&quot; dialog\n\n   box, make sure that the text in the &quot;Application used to\n\n   perform action:&quot; field has the following entry, including the\n\n   double quotes:\n\n      regedit.exe &quot;%1&quot;\n\n7. Click the OK buttons to dismiss all three dialog boxes.\n\n8. You should be able to double-click on the Undo.Reg file now.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nThanks for using RegClean! We hope you find this utility useful.\n\n - The RegClean Team -\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43482d3e1a33639bdf7ec11bec3c4b026a46f6e9","amp;dn":"REGCLEAN+-Lindoff.RAR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43482d3e1a33639bdf7ec11bec3c4b026a46f6e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,72,45,62,26,51,99,155,223,126,193,27,236,60,75,2,106,70,246,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
