William Eythe is a German-American college student approached by the spies to become a secret Nazi operative. Eythe instead heads directly to FBI chief Lloyd Nolan and offers his services as a double agent. His mission is to locate the head of the spy ring, an unseen figure known only as Mr. Christopher, and to that end Eythe infiltrates the ring, headquarted in a town house on 92nd street. Among the conspirators are an erudite German colonel (Leo G. Carroll) and the beautiful female owner of the house (Signe Hasso). Part of the plot involves the smuggling to Germany of America's atomic secrets by a weak-willed document clerk (played by Gene Lockhart, one of the best &quot;cringers&quot; in the business). Dwelling a bit too long on the meticulous research techniques of the FBI, House on 92nd Street picks up momentum in the final sequence, wherein &quot;Mr. Christopher&quot; is revealed and double agent Eythe barely escapes with his skin intact. \n\nD:BT Uploads - para enviarThe House on 92nd Street (1945)The House on 92nd Street.avi\n   General\n      Complete name : D:BT Uploads - para enviarThe House on 92nd Street (1945)The House on 92nd Street.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 1.06 GiB\n      Duration : 1h 27mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 727 Kbps\n      Writing application : FairUse Wizard - http://fairusewizard.com\n      Writing library : The best and REALLY easy backup tool\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (MPEG)\n      Muxing mode : Packed bitstream\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 27mn\n      Bit rate : 1 525 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 464 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 1.379\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.214\n      Stream size : 958 MiB (88%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.2.0.dev47 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : AC-3\n      Format/Info : Audio Coding 3\n      Codec ID : 2000\n      Duration : 1h 27mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 192 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Channel positions : L R\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Stream size : 121 MiB (11%)\n      Alignment : Split accross interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 42 ms (1.00 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 500 ms\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0037795/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0037795/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnglish audio; English, Spanish and Portuguese subpacka (idx/sub)\n\nHenry Hathaway - The House on 92nd Street (1945)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c769189013218b4ac55db3677e8ed760b055987f","amp;dn":"Henry+Hathaway+-+The+House+on+92nd+Street+%281945%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c769189013218b4ac55db3677e8ed760b055987f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,105,24,144,19,33,139,74,197,93,179,103,126,142,215,96,176,85,152,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
