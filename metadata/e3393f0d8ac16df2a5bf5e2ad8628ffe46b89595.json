It monitors and repairs, where necessary,\nfiles during operations such as open, write and copy in on-access mode. Whenever \na user carries out a file operation (e.g. load document, execute, copy), Avira \nPremium Security Suite automatically scans the file. Renaming a file does not \ntrigger a scan by AntiVir Guard. \n\nAntiVir MailGuard\nMailGuard is the interface between your computer and the email server from which \nyour email program (mail client) downloads the emails. MailGuard is connected as \na so-called proxy between the email program and the email server. All incoming \nemails are routed through this proxy, scanned for viruses and unwanted programs \nand forwarded to your email program. Depending on the configuration, the program \nprocesses the affected emails automatically or asks the user for a certain action.\nIn addition, the MailGuard can reliably protect you against spam emails.\n\nAntiVir WebGuard\nWhen surfing the internet, you are using your web browser to request data from \na web server. The data transferred from the web server (HTML files, script and \nimage files, Flash files, video and music streams, etc) will normally be moved \ndirectly into the browser cache for display in the web browser, meaning that an \non-access scan as performed by AntiVir Guard is not possible. This could allow \nviruses and unwanted programs to access your computer system. WebGuard is what \nis known as an HTTP proxy which monitors the ports used for data transfer \n(80, 8080, 3128) and scans the transferred data for viruses and unwanted programs.\nDepending on the configuration, the program may process the affected files \nautomatically or prompt the user for a specific action.\n\nAvira Firewall\nAvira Firewall controls communication to and from your computer. It permits or \ndenies communications based on security policies.\n\nRootkit Detection\nThe Rootkit Detection checks whether software is already installed on your \ncomputer that can no longer be detected with conventional methods of malware \nprotection after penetrating the computer system.\n\nShell Extension\nThe Avira Premium Security Suite Shell Extension generates an entry Scan selected \nfiles with AntiVir in the context menu of the Windows Explorer (right-hand mouse \nbutton). With this entry you can directly scan files or directories.\n\nBackup\nThe Backup component lets you create mirror backups of your data manually and \nautomatically.\n\n\n\nHere are some key features of Avira Premium Security Suite 10:\n\n- Control Center for monitoring, administering and controlling the entire program.\n- Central configuration with user-friendly standard and advanced options and \n  context-sensitive help.\n- Scanner (On-Demand Scan) with profile-controlled and configurable search for \n  all known types of virus and malware.\n- Integration into the Windows Vista User Account Control allows you to carry out \n  tasks requiring administrator rights.\n- Guard (On-Access Scan) for continuous monitoring of all file access attempts.\n- MailGuard (POP3 scanner and SMTP scanner) for the permanent checking of emails \n  for viruses and malware. Checking of email attachments is included.\n- WebGuard for monitoring data and files transferred from the Internet using the \n  HTTP protocol (monitoring of ports 80, 8080, 3128).\n- Backup-component for creating backups of your data (mirror backups).\n- Integrated quarantine management to isolate and process suspicious files.\n- Rootkit protection for detecting hidden malware installed in your computer \n  system (rootkits) (Only for 32-bit systems).\n- Direct access to detailed information on the detected viruses and malware via \n  the Internet.\n- Simple and quick updates to the program, virus definitions, and search engine \n  through Single File Update and incremental VDF updates via a webserver on the \n  Internet.\n- User-friendly licensing in License Manager.\n- Integrated Scheduler to plan one-off or recurring tasks, such as updates or \n  test runs.\n- Extremely high virus and malware detection via innovative scanning technology \n  (scan engine) including heuristic scanning method.\n- Detection of all conventional archive types including detection of nested \n  archives and smart extension detection.\n- High-performance multithreading function (simultaneous high-speed scanning of \n  multiple files).\n- Firewall to protect your computer against illegal access from the Internet or \n  from a network, and against illegal access from the Internet/network by an \n  unauthorized user.\n\n\n\nWhat's new in this release: \n\n- Version 10.0.0.542 is a maintenance release. \n\n\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nFor Avira Premium Security Suite to work perfectly, the computer\nsystem must fulfil the following requirements:\n\n- Computer as from Pentium, at least 266 MHz\n- Windows 2000, SP4 and update rollup 1 \n- Windows XP, SP2 (32 or 64 Bit) \n- Windows Vista (32 or 64 Bit, SP 1 recommended) \n- Windows 7 (32 or 64 Bit)  \n- At least 100 MB of free hard disk memory space (more if using\n  Quarantine for temporary storage)\n- At least 192 MB RAM under Windows 2000/XP\n- At least 512  MB RAM under Windows  Vista\n- For installation: Administrator rights\n- For all installations: Windows Internet Explorer 6.0 or higher\n\n\nNote: \n\n* AntiVir MailGuard will not function if a mail server (e.g. AVM KEN, Exchange) \nis already installed on the computer.

Sometimes also they're \n    added to the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not \n    trusting keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.\n\n02- To avoid AV software removing/blocking clean cracks etc: exclude the crack \n    or folder from being auto-protected &amp; auto-scanned by the AV software.\n\n03- If AV software removed a clean crack usually it can be restored \n    (if it's not in Quarantaine then look at History or something similar).\n\n04- To avoid risks when using cracks also Sandboxie can be used to test them:\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.sandboxie.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.sandboxie.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4918844/Sandboxie_v3.38___Keys_[RH]&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4918844/Sandboxie_v3.38___Keys_[RH]&lt;/a&gt;\n\n05- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first \n    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the \n    original file, repacked it, and uploaded it again.\n\n06- Letting AV software software sending scan results to their companies \n    can cause keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.\n\n07- Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow \n    connections for lots of apps &amp; MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set \n    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.\n\n08- Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!\n\n09- Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads &amp; seeders in a short time \n    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.\n\n10- Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments \n    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply \n    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.\n\n11- In general often there are more fake &amp; negative comments than reliable &amp; \n    positive comments.\n\n12- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is \n    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.\n\n13- Posting FAKE comments &amp; uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!\n\n\nFor reporting bad or suspicious torrents:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor visiting &quot;TPB's Most Ridiculous Comments&quot;:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=24699&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=24699&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor visiting my TPB account:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RobbingHood/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RobbingHood/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThis torrent is scanned with:\n1- Norton Internet Security \n2- Avira AntiVir Premium \n3- avast! Pro Antivirus\n4- Kaspersky Antivirus\n\nAlso scanned with most well known antispyware. Reported malware detected \nby other anti-malware software probably are false positives!\n\n\n&lt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n\n\nTo the &quot;United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users&quot;,\n\nNowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intenionally posting \nfake comments &amp; files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to \nfrustrate TPB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less \ndownloadspeed etc etc. \n\nIt's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people \nwho intenionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files. It's an easy answer against \nthose who intenionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files, which is a never \nending issue. \n\nWhen reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for \none does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app \nand about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! \nLet's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said &amp; posted. \nThings are all up to you, the &quot;United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users&quot;!\n\n\nEnjoy The Pirate Bay\n                                         \n* Status torrent at May 01, 2010 - 23.30 CET: clean, tested &amp; working.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3393f0d8ac16df2a5bf5e2ad8628ffe46b89595","amp;dn":"Avira+Premium+Security+Suite+10.0.0.542+%2B+Trial+Reset+v2.3+%5BRH%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3393f0d8ac16df2a5bf5e2ad8628ffe46b89595","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,57,63,13,138,193,109,242,165,191,94,42,216,98,143,254,70,184,149,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
