PeterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s journey starts in the vibrant city of Colombo where he lived as a small boy. Personal recollections, childhood memories and old friends then propel him forward on a rare exploration of Sri LankaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s depth of culture, culinary diversity, and natural splendour. From Colombo, Peter travels extensively across the country, inland to the sacred city of Kandy and Ceylon tea fields, then along the coastline from Galle in the south to eventually conclude the series in the previously war-torn Jaffna in the far north.\n\nThroughout his travels, Peter is joined by old friends and new, and together they explore the areaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s culture, site-specific ingredients and recipes. Peter cooks at ColomboÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s buzzing Pettah Markets with his childhood nanny, finally perfects a hopper recipe heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s spent 20 years pursuing in Mrs AmarasakaraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s kitchen near Kataragama, and learns how to search for Sri Lankan bush tucker with local conservationists in Yala National Park.\n\nEach episode of My Sri Lanka is a unique expression of Sri Lankan lifestyle and cooking, with Peter KuruvitaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s charm and ancestral ties providing an exceptional level of insight and previously unseen perspective that's bound to leave audiences yearning for more.\n\nwww.sbs.com.au/shows/mysrilanka/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22237abbdcd9c5045a43579e33755651206927a7","amp;dn":"My+Sri+Lanka+with+Peter+Kuruvita","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22237abbdcd9c5045a43579e33755651206927a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,35,122,187,220,217,197,4,90,67,87,158,51,117,86,81,32,105,39,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
