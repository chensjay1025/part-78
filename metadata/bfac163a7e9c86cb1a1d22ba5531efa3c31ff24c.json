He works at the Pittsburgh International Airport as a Transportation Security Administration\nofficer, and hopes of becoming a pilot one day. He tries to get back together with his self-centered ex-girlfriend, Marnie (Lindsay Sloane). Marnie ended her relationship with Kirk two years ago and is highly dismissive of his continued romantic interests. However, she has remained close with Kirk's parents (Debra Jo Rupp and Adam LeFevre) and overbearing brother Dylan (Kyle Bornheimer), continues to participate in family activities along with her new boyfriend Ron, and even lives with Kirk's parents. He has three close male friends who also work at the airport: Stainer (T. J. Miller), Devon (Nate Torrence), and Jack (Mike Vogel).\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0815236/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0815236/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPLEASE SEED AND ENJOY THANKS\n\nscreen shots\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img707.imageshack.us/img707/9886/sheoutofmyleaguexvidvic.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img707.imageshack.us/img707/9886/sheoutofmyleaguexvidvic.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bfac163a7e9c86cb1a1d22ba5531efa3c31ff24c","amp;dn":"She%5C%27s+out+of+my+League+2010.DvDRip.XviD...vice","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bfac163a7e9c86cb1a1d22ba5531efa3c31ff24c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,172,22,58,126,156,134,203,26,29,34,186,85,49,239,163,195,31,242,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
