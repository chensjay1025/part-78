Basically the story of their rivalry for the affections of a girl (Virginia Gilmore), as well as a story of how the telegraph brought communication to the wilderness. Some inept comedy is the only spoiler in an otherwise straightforward telling of an interesting tale. Randolph Scott is excellent as the man with a past hired to protect Western Union from Indian attacks. Robert Young is perfect as the dapper surveyor from back East. This must have been great &quot;Saturday afternoon at the Bijou&quot; sort of fare for kids and the elders who simply wanted to enjoy a good old shoot 'em up western with cowboys and Indians. It's still enjoyable on that level--and you'll see some of the best early technicolor ever captured on film. Deserves more recognition as one of the best of its kind.\n\nVideo\nduration 01:31:33\ncodec mpeg-4\nw/h 512x384\nbitrate 805 kbps\nframe 25\n\nAudio\nmpeg4aac\nsample 44100\nbitrate 128 kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6098bc4c146d4f6ce0f86bff44a629f8b30e8e9","amp;dn":"Western+Union+%28Randolph+Scott%29+%5B1941%5D+%5E%5E+.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6098bc4c146d4f6ce0f86bff44a629f8b30e8e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,9,139,196,193,70,212,246,206,15,134,191,244,74,98,159,139,48,232,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
