With this tool you can remove any unwanted junk from your DVD's such as Antipiracy warnings, trailers, and whatever else you may not want. You can also compress your DVD's to DVD-5 (single layer). If you find that I have left something out in the instructions just let me know.\n\nPlease Seed!! Don't forget to say thanks!!!\n\nPS: This is not a djfred release, however I have tagged him so that more people see this and it gets more seeders.  The quality is as good or very close to as good as djfred's releases and like his releases, they will always be NTSC R1 with English audio.  Subs will always very from dvd to dvd.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d8067c38b4ad61f45589174911848b0c79b4afd","amp;dn":"Armored+NTSC+R1+%282009%29+%5Bctang%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d8067c38b4ad61f45589174911848b0c79b4afd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,128,103,195,139,74,214,31,69,88,145,116,145,24,72,176,199,155,74,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
