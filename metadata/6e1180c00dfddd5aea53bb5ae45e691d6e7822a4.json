Written by Ric Ocasek and produced by Roy Thomas Baker, the song was released as the album's second single. It peaked at number 35 on the U.S. Hot 100 chart, and reached number three in the UK. &quot;My Best Friend's Girl&quot; was included on the soundtrack to the 1979 film Over the Edge, and the song appears on numerous compilation albums, such as the band's 1985 Greatest Hits, 1995's Just What I Needed: The Cars Anthology, and 2002's Complete Greatest Hits. A live version of the song by The New Cars appears on their 2006 debut album, It's Alive!.\n\n&quot;My Best Friend's Girl&quot; begins with chords in the lower register of the guitar, a two-bar progression moving from I to IV to V in F. Hand claps enter in bar  five, and after the eight-bar intro, the first verse begins featuring Ric Ocasek's vocals. An organ is introduced in the first chorus, followed by a rockabilly guitar lick which leads to the second verse. The song is composed in contrasting verse-chorus form. The lyrics depict a man's frustration with a girl who is dating his best friend after the man dated her. The narrator coolly notes, &quot;She's my best friend's girl, but she used to be mine.&quot;\n\nThe Cars is the debut album by the Boston-based American  new wave band The Cars, released in 1978.
