This allows software to run with an emphasis \non performance when performance is needed; such as when playing games, \nediting photos/videos, using processor and memory intensive applications\n[IMG]http://i775.photobucket.com/albums/yy33/ripteam/supram1.jpg[/IMG]\n\nLatest Update: 6.4.5.2010 - \nAdded new feature to accelerate an application by setting the ideal processor core \nthe application and game can run on, \nallowing these programs to take advantage of multi-core processors that are not fully utilized.\n\n\n(1) Run superram.exe\n(2) Register with User/Serial (see SuperRamSERIAL.txt.txt inside the zip file)\n(3) Done, \n\nEnjoy, TrT\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:046e342ff45e298d9d5d26ff382aa2a75f846f43","amp;dn":"SuperRam+6.4.5.2010+%2B+serial-TrT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"046e342ff45e298d9d5d26ff382aa2a75f846f43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,110,52,47,244,94,41,141,157,93,38,255,56,42,162,167,95,132,111,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
