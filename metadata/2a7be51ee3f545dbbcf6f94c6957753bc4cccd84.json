In 2010 Power Plant musicians Mathijs Tieken (drums) and Freek van Emaus (bass) joined the band.\n\nSo far Circus Paranoia has released 2 albums. Defined Skies (2009) is a two-hour rock opera about a science and love. Caveman (2010) draws the image of the caveman, the basic human. All 5 tracks on Caveman are exactly 12 minutes, each track handling another aspect of the Caveman's life.\n\nAll compositions are written by Vinken and Van Son. The music is characterized by a combination of Progressive Rock, Pop and Funk. The band's lyrics are written by Imre van Son.\n\n\nwww.circusparanoia.nl  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.last.fm/music/Circus+paranoia&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.last.fm/music/Circus+paranoia&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a7be51ee3f545dbbcf6f94c6957753bc4cccd84","amp;dn":"Circus+Paranoia+-+Caveman+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a7be51ee3f545dbbcf6f94c6957753bc4cccd84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,123,229,30,227,245,69,219,188,246,249,76,105,87,117,59,196,204,205,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
