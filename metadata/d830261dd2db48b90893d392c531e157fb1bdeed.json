As       \n           familiar as the Headlands are to Jack, he is struck by         \n           all the new development and the loss of woods and marsh        \n           he used to play in as a child. Shortly after arriving to       \n           the house he inherited after his father passed away, Jack      \n           is reunited with his old friend Bob Perkins, who is now        \n           the Sheriff. Bob is in the midst of trying to figure out       \n           what has been killing and mutilating the local animal          \n           population. Several deer over the last week have turned        \n           up ripped to shreds and with the help of Park Ranger           \n           Sandy Parker; the two have concluded that a bear must          \n           have wandered into the area. This theory makes sense to        \n           Jack until he sees something standing in the fog - a           \n           Bigfoot. Naturally, everyone thinks Jack is out of his         \n           mind. But, when some of the local residents meet the same      \n           fate as the deer, suspicions start to arise. This is not       \n           a story about the cuddly, misunderstood giant living in        \n           the Pacific Northwest. It's the story of a clever,             \n           murderous monster living in the marshes and woods of           \n           Northeastern Ohio. This Bigfoot is a victim of                 \n           deforestation and urban sprawl and he is fighting back.        \n                                                                          \n                                                    \n                        \n                            \n                                 \n                                                                          \n           Todd Cox................... : ..............Jack Sullivan      \n           Liza Foster................ : ...............Sandy Parker      \n           Bob Gray................... : ................Bob Perkins      \n           Bettina Steinmetz.......... : ..............Kathy Perkins      \n           Wes Shofner................ : ......Quincy Glasscock M.E.      \n           Saverio Marinelli.......... : ............Deputy Bukowski      \n           Lissy Gulick............... : ...........Loretta Fletcher      \n           Skip Corris................ : ............Monroe Fletcher      \n           Brooke Beckwith............ : ...........Charlie Sullivan      \n           Van Jackson................ : ..............George Hobson      \n           Shawn Kipp................. : ....................Bigfoot      \n           Brad Speck................. : ......................Bubba      \n           Tom Dziak.................. : .......................Phil      \n           Mike Trivissono............ : ......................Frank      \n           Victor Rasanow............. : ......................Ralph      \n                                                                          \n                                                                      \n                      \n                             \n                       \n         \n                                                                        \n                                                                            \n                  Thanks to our friends at KART3LDVD.
