Their enthusiasm is soon to be rewarded with The Lemon Orchard, RiceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s romantic new love story between two people from seemingly different worlds.\n\nIn the five years since Julia last visited her aunt and uncleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s home in Malibu, her life has been turned upside down by her daughterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death. She expects to find nothing more than peace and solitude as she house-sits with only her dog, Bonnie, for company. But she finds herself drawn to the handsome man who oversees the lemon orchard. Roberto expertly tends the trees, using the money to support his extended Mexican family. What connection could these two people share? The answer comes as Roberto reveals the heartbreaking story of his own lossÃ¢â‚¬â€a pain Julia knows all too well, but for one striking difference: RobertoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s daughter was lost but never found. And despite the odds he cannot bear to give up hope.\n\nSet in the sea and citrus-scented air of the breathtaking Santa Monica Mountains, The Lemon Orchard is an affirming story about the redemptive power of compassion and the kind of love that seems to find us when we need it most.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:369f536331f8ec46c826355a8251fd6390a8214b","amp;dn":"The+Lemon+Orchard","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"369f536331f8ec46c826355a8251fd6390a8214b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,159,83,99,49,248,236,70,200,38,53,90,130,81,253,99,144,168,33,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
