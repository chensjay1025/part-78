The antagonist, KrÃƒÂ¡l Groznyj rules over a vast region of land, fearing no one but those foretold in an ancient prophecy to be his own downfall. The prophecy claims that children of his own nephews would one day rise up and destroy him. From there the story covers several generations of people living in Tzenebraum, otherwise known as &quot;The Thrice-Nine Lands&quot;.\n\nThe comic is an epic fantasy adventure containing many references (both in mythology and language) to Slovakian lore. Many of the characters names as well as certain phrases are taken from Slavic languages. The series earned several award nominations, such as Golden Chazzie nominations for Best Ongoing Series and Best Artist for 2006. Wizard Comics Magazine rated it number 4 in its 2007 top 40 indie comics.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:907cb393ff38b0eabc421937fecc6d52fbe5071c","amp;dn":"Archaic+%28Restored%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"907cb393ff38b0eabc421937fecc6d52fbe5071c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,124,179,147,255,56,176,234,188,66,25,55,254,204,109,82,251,229,7,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
