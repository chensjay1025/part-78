I have tested the program and it is error free!\n\nPlease remember to comment ^-^\n\n-----\n\nUpdate: 6/12/10\naTV Flash is a &quot;hack&quot; for Apple TV which allows you to upload and play almost any file extension without the limitations of iTunes or Quicktime. This means Soft Subtitles are now a possibility (the primary reason why I installed it on my apple TV). It also includes 3rd party application support and a fully integrated web browser. XBMC and Boxee are also plugins that come fully integrated. This is only the start of what aTV Flash can do.\n\nPlease be warned that installing this hack may void your warranty, but you can easily remove it at any time. Also any updates from apple may wipe out any plugins and even this hack itself.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99b416c135894cc09d8f6b1d8fc1589907dc9ad0","amp;dn":"Details+for+aTV+Flash+4.1.3+-+LATEST+%26+Working%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99b416c135894cc09d8f6b1d8fc1589907dc9ad0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,180,22,193,53,137,76,192,157,143,107,29,143,193,88,153,7,220,154,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
