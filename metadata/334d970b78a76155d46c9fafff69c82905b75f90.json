Born in the village of Resembool from the country of Amestris (ÃƒÂ£Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÂ£Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¹ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã‹â€ ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã‚ÂªÃƒÂ£Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¹ Amesutorisu?), the two brothers lived there with their mother. Their father, Van Hohenheim, left home for unknown reasons and years later, their mother, Trisha Elric, died of a terminal illness leaving the Elric brothers alone. After their mother's death, Edward became determined to bring her back through the use of alchemy, an advanced science in which objects can be created from raw materials. They researched Human Transmutation, a forbidden art in which one attempts to create or modify a human being. However, this attempt failed, ultimately resulting in the loss of Edward's left leg and Alphonse's entire body. In a desperate effort to save his brother, Edward sacrificed his right arm to affix Alphonse's soul to a suit of armor. Some days later, an alchemist named Roy Mustang visited the Elric brothers, and he told Edward to become a member of the State Military of the country to find a way to recover their bodies. After that, Edward's left leg and right arm were replaced with automail, a type of advanced prosthetic limb, created for him by his close family friends Winry Rockbell and her grandmother Pinako.\n\nPLEASE SEED GUYS, depending on how many seeds I'll get on here will make my decision on Uploading the rest, THANK YOU!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:334d970b78a76155d46c9fafff69c82905b75f90","amp;dn":"Full+Metal+Alchemist+Brotherhood+English+Dub+Episode+1-10+OMEGAu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"334d970b78a76155d46c9fafff69c82905b75f90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,77,151,11,120,167,97,85,212,108,159,175,255,105,200,41,5,183,95,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
