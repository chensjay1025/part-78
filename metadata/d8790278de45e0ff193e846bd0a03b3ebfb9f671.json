Five years in the making, it was the most expensive nature documentary series ever commissioned by the BBC, and also the first to be filmed in high definition.[1] The series was co-produced by the Discovery Channel and NHK in association with the CBC, and was described by its makers as &quot;the definitive look at the diversity of our planet&quot;.\n\nPlanet Earth was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC One in March 2006, and premiered one year later in the USA on the Discovery Channel. By June 2007, it had been shown in 130 countries worldwide.[2] The original BBC version was narrated by David Attenborough and produced by Alastair Fothergill. For Discovery, the executive producer was Maureen Lemire, with Sigourney Weaver's voiceover replacing Attenborough's.\n\nThe series comprises eleven episodes, each of which features a global overview of a different biome or habitat on Earth. At the end of each fifty-minute episode, a ten-minute featurette takes a behind-the-scenes look at the challenges of filming the series.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img.sharedmp3.net/files/pics/699/698335/img_1_pr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img.sharedmp3.net/files/pics/699/698335/img_1_pr.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nDISK 1:\n\n01 - Prelude                             1:57\n\n02 - The Journey of the Sun              3:28\n\n03 - Hunting Dogs                        3:26\n\n04 - Elephants in the Okavango           3:07\n\n05 - Diving into the Darkness            3:01\n\n06 - Stalactite Gallery                  2:26\n\n07 - Bat Hunt                            2:59\n\n08 - Discovering Deer Cave               3:49\n\n09 - Angel Falls                         2:21\n\n10 - River Predation                     4:09\n\n11 - Iguacu                              2:06\n\n12 - The Snow Geese                      2:01\n\n13 - The Geladas                         2:39\n\n14 - The Snow Leopard                    4:00\n\n15 - The Karakoram                       1:54\n\n16 - The Earth's Highest Challenge       5:31\n\n17 - Desert Winds / The Locusts          4:58\n\n18 - Fly Catchers                        1:42\n\n19 - Namibia Ã¢â‚¬â€ The Lions and the Oryx    5:10\n\nDISK 2\n\n01 - Plains High and Low                 2:40\n\n02 - The Wolf and the Caribou            3:47\n\n03 - Tibet (Reprise) / Close             3:46\n\n04 - Surfing Dolphins                    2:41\n\n05 - Dangerous Landing                   3:20\n\n06 - Mother and Calf Ã¢â‚¬â€ The Great Journey 5:19\n\n07 - The Canopy / Flying Lemur           2:45\n\n08 - Frog Ballet / Jungle Falls          3:37\n\n09 - The Cordyceps                       2:55\n\n10 - Hunting Chimps                      4:10\n\n11 - The Redwoods                        4:40\n\n12 - Fledglings                          3:43\n\n13 - Seasonal Change                     5:40\n\n14 - Discovering Antarctica              2:42\n\n15 - The Humpbacks' Bubblenet            2:59\n\n16 - Everything Leaves but the Emperors  2:27\n\n17 - The Disappearing Sea Ice            3:45\n\n18 - Lost in the Storm                   1:16\n\n19 - A School of Five Hundred            3:39\n\n20 - Giant Mantas                        2:50\n\n21 - Life Near the Surface               2:06\n\n22 - The Choice is Ours                  3:13","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8790278de45e0ff193e846bd0a03b3ebfb9f671","amp;dn":"BC+Frozen+Planet+OST+-+George+Fenton+%5B198-236kbps+Variable%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8790278de45e0ff193e846bd0a03b3ebfb9f671","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,121,2,120,222,69,224,255,25,62,132,107,208,160,59,62,191,185,246,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
