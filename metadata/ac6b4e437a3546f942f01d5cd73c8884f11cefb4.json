A growing body of evidence documents that maternal health before conception, prenatal and perinatal exposures, and conditions in childhood play critical roles in health over the life course.\n\nScientific understanding of the multiple and interacting influences on child health and their role in later health continues to evolve rapidly, but greater attention to how families shape the conditions of early life that underlie childhood health is needed. This volume aims to advance understanding of this topic, with attention to mechanisms through which health disparities emerge and are sustained across the lifespan.?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac6b4e437a3546f942f01d5cd73c8884f11cefb4","amp;dn":"Families+and+Child+Health+%28PDF%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac6b4e437a3546f942f01d5cd73c8884f11cefb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,107,78,67,122,53,70,249,66,240,29,92,215,60,136,132,241,28,239,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
