When\n      bystanders get caught up in a bungled armed robbery and one of\n      them is kidnapped, what effect do weapons and fear have on their\n      memories? High-tech eye-tracker cameras allow us to compare what\n      witnesses remember from the crime with what they actually saw.\n      The difference between recall and recognition is illustrated by\n      witnesses who can't describe suspects they clearly saw.\n      \n     \n                                                      Group Notes...\n        We are looking for:                           \n                                                                     \n      .EU Affil sites, NO COLO/RENTED.                              \n                                                                     \n      Retail TV dvds before the retail date.                        \n                                                                     \n      Can't get in contact with us?
