It's a bunch of unemployed actors with a simple camera and a good idea for a comedy - nothing else!\nThe result is nothing less than a good movie in doubtable quality, that has thrilled audiences at film festivals around the country. If you are a true movie lover, who cares more about plot and acting than looks and quality, you will appreciate this one.\n\n4.7 score on IMDB - well done for a movie with no budget.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ee659a5f3adfba641453afe5aeb684e3674c742","amp;dn":"The.Truth.About.Average.Guys.2009.DvdRip.Xvid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ee659a5f3adfba641453afe5aeb684e3674c742","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,230,89,165,243,173,251,166,65,69,58,254,90,235,104,78,54,116,199,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
