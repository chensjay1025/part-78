In 1970 he founded The Modern Lovers, an influential proto-punk band. Since the mid-1970s, Richman has worked either solo or with low-key, generally acoustic backing. He is known for his wide-eyed, unaffected and child-like outlook, and music that, while rooted in rock and roll, often draws on influences from around the world.\n\nEarly life\nBorn in Natick, Massachusetts, Richman began playing music and writing his own songs in the mid-1960s. He became infatuated with The Velvet Underground, and in 1969 he moved to New York City, lived on the couch of their manager, Steve Sesnick, worked odd jobs and tried to break in as a professional musician. Failing at this, he returned to Boston.\n\nCareer\nThe Modern Lovers\nWhile in Boston, Richman formed The Modern Lovers, a proto-punk garage rock band. Other notable members of the group were keyboard player Jerry Harrison and drummer David Robinson, who later joined Talking Heads and The Cars. Many of the group's songs feature Boston-based topics.~\n\n~In Great Britain, Richman was recognised as a progenitor of the punk rock scene, and several of his singles became hits. &quot;Roadrunner&quot; reached Number 11 in the UK pop charts, and its follow-up, the instrumental &quot;Egyptian Reggae&quot;, made Number 5 in late 1977. &quot;Egyptian Reggae&quot; was a version of Jamaican musician Earl Zero's reggae song &quot;None Shall Escape the Judgment&quot;; Zero was credited as co-writer on Richman's later versions of the track.\nRead the hole article on: &lt;a href=&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Richman&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Richman&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThe Modern Lovers\nThe Modern Lovers were an American rock band led by Jonathan Richman in the 1970s and 1980s.\nThe original band, billed simply as &quot;The Modern Lovers&quot;, existed from 1970ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“74 but their recordings were not released until 1976 or later. It featured Richman and bassist Ernie Brooks with drummer David Robinson (later of The Cars) and keyboardist Jerry Harrison (later of Talking Heads). The sound of the band owed a great deal to the influence of The Velvet Underground, and is now sometimes classed as &quot;protopunk&quot;. It pointed the way towards much of the punk rock, new wave, alternative and indie rock music of later decades. Their only album, the eponymous The Modern Lovers, contained stylistically unprecedented[citation needed] songs about dating awkwardness, growing up in Massachusetts, and love of life and the USA.\n\nLater, between 1976 and 1988, Richman used the name Modern Lovers for a variety of backing bands, always billed as &quot;Jonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers.&quot; These bands were quieter and featured more low-key, often near-childlike, songs, as Richman drew on folk-rock and other genres. Out of Richman's original bandmates, only Robinson was part of any of the other Modern Lovers incarnations.\nRead the hole article on: &lt;a href=&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Modern_Lovers&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Modern_Lovers&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLegs &amp; Co.\nLegs &amp; Co. were a female dance troupe who were mainly associated with their appearances on the BBC television series Top of the Pops between 1976 and 1981.\n\nThe new dance troupe were formed as a hasty replacement for Ruby Flipper, a multi-racial and mixed-sex septet (later sextet and quintet) who took over dancing duties on Top of the Pops from the popular and long-running female dance group Pan's People in May 1976. The troupe were put together, and managed by, choreographer and founding member of Pan's People, Flick Colby, and fellow Pan's People dancer Ruth Pearson.\n\nMembers\nThe original Legs &amp; Co. line-up consisted of:\nLulu Cartwright\nGillian (Gill) Clarke\nPatti Hammond\nRosemary (Rosie) Hetherington\nSusan (Sue) Menhenick\nPauline Peters\n\nSue (who replaced Louise Clarke as a member of Pan's People in 1974), Patti and Lulu had been members of Ruby Flipper, and it was decided that they should remain as part of the new line-up. Three further dancers were chosen to complete the sextet: Gill had been a finalist in the Miss UK 1976 contest, Rosie was a student at the Italia Conti stage school, and Pauline, the first black female dancer to appear as a member of a dance troupe on Top of the Pops, had appeared on stage in various West End productions.\n\nAlthough Pan's People are more fondly remembered by past TOTP viewers, the original Legs &amp; Co. line-up stayed together longer than any of the various Pan's People line-ups. During their time on the show, only one personnel change occurred within the troupe; when Pauline Peters left the group in March 1981, she was eventually replaced by singer and dancer Anita Mahadervan, the first Asian dancer to appear on Top of the Pops.\nRead the hole article on: &lt;a href=&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legs_&amp;_Co.&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legs_&amp;_Co.&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37ebeaa26925ac6d9b8bd280c7c5ca68e17f154b","amp;dn":"EGYPTIAN+REGGAE+-+JONATHAN+RICHMAN+%28AWESOME+VIDEO+WITH+DANCING+C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37ebeaa26925ac6d9b8bd280c7c5ca68e17f154b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,235,234,162,105,37,172,109,155,139,210,128,199,197,202,104,225,127,21,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
