I actually got this from here and just made the audio MUCH better. I doubt a better copy of this will ever be seen unless there is an official release, someone feels like doing a better VHS transfer, or someone fixes this video up a bit. I don't really know anything about video editing so I stayed away from that. This hasn't been transcoded from the format I got it in so to keep the quality at least as good as it already is.\n\n1. The video is untouched.\n2. Audition was used for noise reduction, high-quality time stretching of the replacement music, and dubbing of the highest-quality copies of the songs I could find on top of the existing music.\n3. VirtualDub was used to mux the 192Kbps MP3 audio in to the AVI.\n\nNote: The reason this file is so much smaller than the source AVI is because the audio is MP3. The original audio was wave.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d629378b61014f41dffe17d7fdd3986ccc920476","amp;dn":"Cardiacs+-+Seaside+Treats+%28Partially+Restored+Audio%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d629378b61014f41dffe17d7fdd3986ccc920476","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,41,55,139,97,1,79,65,223,254,23,215,253,211,152,108,204,146,4,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
