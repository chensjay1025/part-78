Blackwaterside  \n2. Nacht Tanz/Shaeffertanz \n3. Maid in Bedlam  \n4. Gypsy Dance/Jews Dance   \n5. John Barleycorn \n6. Reynardine \n7. My Johnny Was a Shoemaker \n8. Death and the Lady   \n9. Battle of Augrham/5 in a Line  \n10. Talk About Suffering  \n\nOriginally released (on LP) in 1977, this is the first and finest album album by the John Renbourn group. In addition to Renbourn as one of the best fingerstyle guitarists around, the band is rounded out with former Pentangle vocalist Jacqui McShee, Sue Draheim (fiddle), Tony Roberts (flute, recorders, oboe, piccolo) and Keshave Sathe (tabla and finger cymbals).\nWhile the tabla adds an Eastern sound to the music, this is traditional British folk music at its finest. The opening cut is the traditional &quot;Black Waterside&quot; arranged by Renbourn with a heavenly vocal provided by McShee. [Along with Sandy Denny, McShee is my favorite British female vocalist.] Other standouts include the title track (another McShee vocal), &quot;John Barleycorn,&quot; &quot;Reynardine&quot; and a stunning a cappella rendition of &quot;Talk About Suffering.&quot; [If you are not deeply moved by that song, you might want to check your pulse...there's a good chance you're dead!]\n\nThe John Renbourn Group went on to record two more albums (with John Molineux replacing Sue Draheim), but if you can only afford one, this is it. There is not a weak track on the album.
