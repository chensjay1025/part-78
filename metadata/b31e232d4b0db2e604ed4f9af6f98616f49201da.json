Her brother is bred, for one sole purpose: to avenge his sisterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death. Kazakh master Ermek ShinarbaevÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s close collaboration with the Korean-Russian writer Anatoli Kim yielded three great films, the most remarkable of which is this beautiful, profoundly unsettling film. A true odyssey, geographically and psychologically. One of the greatest films to emerge from the Kazakh New Wave, and one of the toughest.\n\nPLEASE SEED AT LEAST AS MUCH AS YOU DOWNLOAD SO THIS TORRENT WILL NEVER DIE!
