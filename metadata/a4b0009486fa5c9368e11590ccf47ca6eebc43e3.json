My thanks to Hatful Of Hollow of the DCP for scanning this TPB.\n\nBatgirl: Year One is a 9-issue mini-series published during 2003. Written by Scott Beatty and Chuck Dixon, with art by Alvaro Lopez and Marcos Martin, the series depicts Barbara Gordon's origin as Batgirl.  Batgirl: Year One makes several changes to Barbara Gordon's origin myth in order to reestablish her characterization in the Modern Age of Comics.\n\nThe story begins with Barbara Gordon having an internal monologue while battling Killer Moth and his henchmen, while dressed in a female version of Batman's costume.  Flashbacks within her mind retell the series of events which have lead up to her first battle with a supervillain.\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4b0009486fa5c9368e11590ccf47ca6eebc43e3","amp;dn":"Batgirl+-+Year+One+TPB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4b0009486fa5c9368e11590ccf47ca6eebc43e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,176,0,148,134,250,92,147,104,225,21,144,204,244,124,166,238,188,67,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
