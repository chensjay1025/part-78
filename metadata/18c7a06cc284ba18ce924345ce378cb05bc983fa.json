No other Tools i've used except Dism &amp; ImageX.\n\nI create this for who want to default OS with no update, no hotfix, no patch, because as we know, the Updates or Hotfix are often issue crash, problem, Error, BSOD in some case, no compatible with some software, etc, so  i stop Update, so i dont want Update, so i want to back to The Default :)\n \nThe Pre-activate methode is using Windows Loader 2.2.1 By Daz for Non VL Edition and KMS OEM Folder 2.4.5 v1 by murphy78 for Enterprise VL.\n\nThe Compillation are done. Reboot normal, pre-activate normal, no problem during shutdown after pre-activate by Windows Loader or KMSServerService, both work normal. Tested by me using Vitual Box n my pc :P\n\nThe Scripts folder inside Setup folder will deleted by setupcomplete.cmd command RD /S /Q added reg add RunsOnce Delete Folder, so no left over when you enter desktop.\n\nBoth VL and non VL Editions are Pre-activate, i don't add-package and add-driver for this compillation, why? because i want make default, just that :)\n\nSources for Non VL:\n64-bit:\nX17-59465.iso --&gt; Windows 7 Ultimate SP1-U x64 by Digital Media Refresh with included KB2534111 for some hotfix\n32-bit:\nX17-59463.iso --&gt; Windows 7 Ultimate SP1-U x86 by Digital Media Refresh with included KB2534111 for some hotfix\n\nSources for VL:\n64-bit:\nen_windows_7_enterprise_with_sp1_x64_dvd_u_677651.iso --&gt; Windows 7 Enterprise SP1-U x64 by Digital Media Refresh with included KB2534111 for some hotfix\n32-bit:\nen_windows_7_enterprise_with_sp1_x86_dvd_u_677710.iso --&gt; Windows 7  Enterprise SP1-U x86 by Digital Media Refresh with included KB2534111 for some hotfix\n\nabout Installation Index, i dont rename the Display Name and Display Description and Image Name and Image Description, except Image Name for x64 index i added x64 name during proses imaging with imageX.\n\nscreenshot: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/oANknAAEo&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/oANknAAEo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/pAnkFaAeO&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/pAnkFaAeO&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThats all, Thanks all.\nSeed and enjoy. \nSory for my bad english, because in my county i never speak english:D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18c7a06cc284ba18ce924345ce378cb05bc983fa","amp;dn":"Windows+7+SP1-U+AIO+x86+x64+Pre-Activate","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18c7a06cc284ba18ce924345ce378cb05bc983fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,199,160,108,194,132,186,24,206,146,67,69,206,55,140,176,91,201,131,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
