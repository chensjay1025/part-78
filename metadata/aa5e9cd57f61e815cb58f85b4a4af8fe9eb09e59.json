Some highlights:\n\n    * Trillion dollar deficits through 2011 and resuming in 2018\n    * By 2020, federal debt would rise to 90% of GDP.\n\nAnd Congress continues the ignore the biggest debt: the $42 Trillion unfunded liability of Medicare and Social Security.\n\nOn tonight's show (Fox Business at 8pm &amp; 11pm ET), I'll take a look at the burden that my generation is passing onto our children. We ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the baby boomers-- are basically stealing from babies to pay our retirement benefits.\n\nRep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) and Mercatus Center economist Veronique de Rugy will talk about the financial picture we face. David Certner of the AARP will try to explain why this generational wealth transfer must continue. Author Joel Kotkin will explain how other countries have it worse (thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s actually good newsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½maybe we will learn something from places like Japan and EuropeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½where birth rates are lowerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½because their pension systems will explode first). Plus, I'll confront a lawyer who worsens the entitlement crisis by helping people hide assets so they can collect Medicaid benefits meant to go to the poor.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa5e9cd57f61e815cb58f85b4a4af8fe9eb09e59","amp;dn":"20100325-Stossel-%5BCongressional+Ponzi%5D.Fox+Business.CF.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa5e9cd57f61e815cb58f85b4a4af8fe9eb09e59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,94,156,213,127,97,232,21,203,88,248,91,74,74,248,254,158,176,158,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
