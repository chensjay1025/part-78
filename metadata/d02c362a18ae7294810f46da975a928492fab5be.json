Some of the stuff they air now are cut together \n\twith segments from different old episodes. Some segments\n\tare &quot;stolen&quot; from CMT Cribs. We will tag these with the\n\tnames of the people featured as other groups started with\n\tafter S12. \n\t\n\tINFO:\n\t\n\tMINDTHEGAP is living up to its groupname. We do mind all\n\tthe gaps in archives out there. If we see a rerun airing\n\tof unreleased eps from series we try to get it. If the\n\tshow is really old and the hope of finding the original\n\trelease is gone, we try to fix that too with iNTERNALs. \n\t\n\tThis of course makes our releases a bit random and some\n\tmight think we are mad but there will be a reason behind\n\tthe madness.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d02c362a18ae7294810f46da975a928492fab5be","amp;dn":"MTV.Cribs.Verne.Troyer_Christian.Audigier_Al.Harrington.WS.DSR.X","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d02c362a18ae7294810f46da975a928492fab5be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,44,54,42,24,174,114,148,129,15,70,218,151,90,146,132,146,250,181,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
