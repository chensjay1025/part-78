There are no gimmicks, they don't even send you an email. If you do register, you can also send your own referral code to somebody else and you get an extra 20GB added to your existing 20GB.\nYou can purchase extra bandwidth if you like - 200GB $0.99, 1 TB $3.99 or 2TB $6.99. There are no expiries on these.\n.\n  Once you've registered things seem pretty good. When you upload a torrent to them you have to disable PEX but eveything else is just basic. If you use up your 20GB within 30 days, you can either purchase more or simply wait it out until your 30 days is up and you get 20GB more. There are no purchase commitments. As far as storage space, it's unlimited but if something has not been accessed for 14 days, it will be removed. As far as support, they got back to me within the hour. 8 of my friends have been able to register and I have been credited with an additional 160GB bandwidth. You are able to set the upload ratio on each individual torrent so that one torrent doesn't use up everything. The interface is very straightforward. \n\n*** I have included a screenshot of the FAQ page","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9faacb96063a71868506243dfe82a8a9b515784","amp;dn":"Free+20GB+per+month+Seedbox","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9faacb96063a71868506243dfe82a8a9b515784","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,250,172,185,96,99,167,24,104,80,98,67,223,232,42,138,155,81,87,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
