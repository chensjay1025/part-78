So I choose this way to describe to get WindowBlinds7 work. Therefore this is not a torrent rather than a description. Please thank piratebay for this!\n\nI needed a torrent to post here -&gt; DO NOT download this torrent.\n\nOkay, it seems that WB8 works with themes for WB8 only - do NOT use wba's from WB7 or WB6 - result will be changed to classic mode if starts.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8815782/WindowBlinds_8_-_Full_Version_%28with_Patch%29_-__K_llERoY512_&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8815782/WindowBlinds_8_-_Full_Version_%28with_Patch%29_-__K_llERoY512_&lt;/a&gt;\n\nHere is my solution (please understand that I do not have time to control the 30 days trail - please post here if it should not work):\n\nYou need the correct version and the correct patch if you want to use wbas for WB7!\n\nVersion 7.3 seems to work (available here):\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.filehorse.com/download-windowblinds/8863&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.filehorse.com/download-windowblinds/8863&lt;/a&gt;\n\nYou need the correct patch:\n\n\nYou must be logged in to download from 4shared - account is free. Sorry, I have tried this page only and works - there are other filehosters with this file - post if you know a better way to get this file (it has to be the same of course). :)\n\nPlease control version of &quot;WindowBlinds7_public.exe&quot; by clicking right mouse button and choose tab Details. You will see under version for data i.e. 7.3.0.0.\n\nInstall note:\n1. disable network connector\n2. install wb7.3\n3. block with firewall -&gt; pay attention to the video in Extras\n3. reboot in save mode -&gt; Start -&gt; type &quot;msconfig&quot; -&gt; Start/StartOptions -&gt; Safe Mode\n4. copy patch in WB main folder i.e. C:Program Files (x86)StardockObject DesktopWindowBlinds\n5. run patch as administrator under 7/Vista -&gt; wait till patching is done\n6. reboot system and activate network connector\n\nIf something should not work please inform the other users (possibly tell proposal for solution) - I am not the uploader of WB7 and I try to gear the featured programs and cracks on this page.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e384fa37f96e527f20b3f4ac3578bd72cbeaa6b","amp;dn":"WindowBlinds+7.3+with+Patch+%28info+only%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e384fa37f96e527f20b3f4ac3578bd72cbeaa6b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,56,79,163,127,150,229,39,242,11,63,74,195,87,139,215,44,190,170,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
