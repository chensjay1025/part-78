ICP.com took these episodes off the site so now these bitches are almost non existent.   and when they did host them they'd only play in quicktime at like an inch and a half by inch and a half.  that shit was ridiculous.  when you run these mpeg files in vlc though you can blow them up full screen.  which is the shit.     this is a pretty awsome juggalo torrent.  and nick flanagen if you see this post...  FUCK OFF!!!!!!!   lol  woop woop ninjas","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54c39ed650fd1de4c87f96d68bfde4ba7928cf5a","amp;dn":"Shaggy+Show++og","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54c39ed650fd1de4c87f96d68bfde4ba7928cf5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,195,158,214,80,253,29,228,200,127,150,214,139,253,228,186,121,40,207,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
