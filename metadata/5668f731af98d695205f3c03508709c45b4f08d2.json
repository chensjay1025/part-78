The Scratch Band, \nincluding members G. E. Smith and Mickey Curry, were noted throughout the Northeast for their \nincendiary live shows. The band released two LP's: the first was picked up by Decca and EMI \nworldwide, with Christine's stark piano-accompanied version of Dusty Springfield's &quot;I Only \nWant To Be With You&quot; becoming a turntable hit in the U.K. The Scratch Band parted in the early \neighties, and lead vocalist Christine Ohlman embarked on a solo career under Trod Nossel's \nmanagement and production company. She later reunited with both Smith and fellow Scratch Band member \nPaul Ossala when she joined the Saturday Night Live (SNL) Band for the 1991-1992 season.\n\n\n01 - When We Dance\n02 - Wonder\n03 - Don't Go No Further\n04 - Prisoner Of Romance\n05 - Last Song\n06 - Rock And Roll Love Letter\n07 - Make It Better\n08 - Danny And Laura\n09 - One Night (For Eddie)\n10 - I Only Want To Be With You\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5668f731af98d695205f3c03508709c45b4f08d2","amp;dn":"The+Scratch+Band+%28Vinyl-rip%2C+1977%29+-+Rock","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5668f731af98d695205f3c03508709c45b4f08d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,104,247,49,175,152,214,149,32,95,60,3,80,135,9,196,91,79,8,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
