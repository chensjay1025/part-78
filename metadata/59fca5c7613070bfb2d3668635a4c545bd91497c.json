These are five stories about the everyday life in Ajami. A great story about small hopes and dreams in an average-Israeli-reality in which no one is sacred. A story involving cops, corruption, drugs, weapons, love, siblings, illegal immigrants and fastfood - everything you'll find in the cities these days. \nNominated for Oscar. Another 13 wins &amp; 5 nominations\n\nSpoken languages: Hebrew and arabic.\nSubtititles: English\n\nI downloaded the movie from TPB and included the subtitles file (.srt) that I found somewhere else. The subtitles aren't always 100% and they are partially on top of the hebrew subtitles (when they speak arabic), but they are good enough. \nPlays in VLC-player. \n\nThis movie is definitely worth to watch!!! I think the story is great and has a surprising twist.\n\nimdb.com/title/tt1077262/\n\nCheck out my other torrents: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/azitromax/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/azitromax/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59fca5c7613070bfb2d3668635a4c545bd91497c","amp;dn":"ajami.%282009%29EngSub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59fca5c7613070bfb2d3668635a4c545bd91497c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,252,165,199,97,48,112,191,178,211,102,134,53,164,197,69,189,145,73,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
