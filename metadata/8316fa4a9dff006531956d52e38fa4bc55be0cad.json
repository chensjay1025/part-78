In an attempt to study his DNA and cellular structure they thaw the specimen and are shocked to discover that he is alive and able to function. Dr Stanley Shepard (Hutton), a renegade anthropologist surrounded by scientists eager to make medical experiments, is allowed contact with the Iceman in an effort to learn from the ancient human being. In a confined prehistoric world that has been recreated in the remote and barren tundra, the two men begin to understand one another, sharing dialogue and an emotional connection. Dr Shepard's bond with the Iceman, whom he names &quot;Charlie&quot;, grows strong as he begins to understand his spirituality as well as his inability to deal with the pressures of the modern world. Ultimately, Dr Shepard must fight for the freedom of the Neanderthal prisoner before he becomes a medical experiment or media sensation. Featuring superb special effects makeup and astonishing aerial footage of frozen glaciers and tundra.\n\n\nthanks goes to Leni @ tik","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8316fa4a9dff006531956d52e38fa4bc55be0cad","amp;dn":"Iceman+%281984%29+PAL+DVD5+VIDEO_TS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8316fa4a9dff006531956d52e38fa4bc55be0cad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,22,250,74,157,255,0,101,49,149,109,82,227,143,164,188,85,190,12,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
