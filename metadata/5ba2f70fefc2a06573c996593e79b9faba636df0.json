John &quot;Hannibal&quot; Smith and his team were framed for robbing the Bank of Hanoi (which they had done, but under orders), and sent to a US military prison. They escaped and went on the run, pursued first by Col. Lynch and later by Col. Decker. While on the lam, they became heroes for hire, working as good-guy vigilantes around the US or the world. Hannibal was their leader and an expert at disguises. Face was the team's con artist and lady's man. BA (officially &quot;Bad Attitude&quot;) was their mechanic, but also took care of mayhem and intimidation. The final member of the Team, &quot;Howling Mad&quot; Murdock, was an expert pilot, and a certified lunatic--they broke him out of a mental hospital whenever they needed him for a mission.\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084967/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084967/&lt;/a&gt;\nGenre:Action | Adventure | Crime\nMOVIEmeter: Up 71% in popularity this week.\n\n \nVideo\n\nID : 0\nFormat : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile : Simple@L1\nFormat settings, BVOP : No\nFormat settings, QPel : No\nFormat settings, GMC : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix : Default (H.263)\nCodec ID : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint : XviD\nDuration : 1h 50mn\nBit rate : 1 684 Kbps\nWidth : 720 pixels\nHeight : 288 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 2.500\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\nResolution : 8 bits\nColorimetry : 4:2:0\nScan type : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.325\nStream size : 1.31 GiB (92%)\nWriting library : Lavc52.41.0\n\n\n\nAudio\n\n\nID : 1\nFormat : MPEG Audio\nFormat version : Version 1\nFormat profile : Layer 3\nCodec ID : 55\nCodec ID/Hint : MP3\nDuration : 1h 50mn\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nStream size : 102 MiB (7%)\nAlignment : Split accross interleaves\nInterleave, duration : 40 ms (1.00 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration : 500 ms\n\n\n\n\nScreenshots\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.com/image/17000/16732.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.com/image/17000/16732.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.com/image/17000/16733.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.com/image/17000/16733.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ba2f70fefc2a06573c996593e79b9faba636df0","amp;dn":"The.A-Team.2010.V2.TS.XViD-PrisM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ba2f70fefc2a06573c996593e79b9faba636df0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,162,247,15,239,194,160,101,115,201,150,89,62,121,185,250,186,99,109,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
