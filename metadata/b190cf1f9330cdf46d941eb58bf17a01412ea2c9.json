The parts of it about passages are excerpts from the shipÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s log and the time spent on the islands is from my diary. It is all true, a few names are changed because IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve forgotten them over the past two years. When I left, I had no idea of writing a book, I was just planning to sail to Hawaii for a little vacation. But one thing led to another, and thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s how it happened. In the two months since IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve gotten back, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been asked a number of times, Ã¢â‚¬Å“What made you decide to do it?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not really sure; I was in a job that was frustrating and didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t seem to be improving and had been going to night school trying to finish off a degree in Psychology that appeared to be another dead-end. It just seemed time to try something new. I had greatly enjoyed a two-week backpacking vacation in Hawaii, and decided that might be a nice place to sail to, so I bought Mahina, quit my job, and got a part-time job helping to build a 45Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ sailboat to learn more about boats and help my suffering budget. I repaired Mahina Ã¢â‚¬Ëœs frozen engine, replaced all standing and running rigging, and generally rebuilt her. In July of 1974, I felt I had Mahina ready to go to sea. I had taken a celestial navigation course (but hadnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t done the homework) and had a grand total of about nine months sailing experience in Puget Sound in my previous 20Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ sloop, but had never done any offshore sailing. I had no special goals in mind, and wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t out to set any records. The trip and this book just developed, and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m offering them to you at this stage, because in a very real sense my relationship with Mahina is still an unfinished story.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b190cf1f9330cdf46d941eb58bf17a01412ea2c9","amp;dn":"Log+of+the+Mahina+-+John+Neal","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b190cf1f9330cdf46d941eb58bf17a01412ea2c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,144,207,31,147,48,205,244,109,148,30,181,139,241,122,1,65,46,162,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
