This incredible underwater adventure gives you extraordinary glimpses of unbelievable creatures that live in an alien world in the deepest depths of the sea. Could these alien life forms be clues to life in outer space? It's an exciting exploration you'll not soon forget.\n\n\n\n\nJames Cameron takes another foray into the depths with a new deep-sea documentary. Following the shipwreck of Ghosts of the Abyss, Cameron focuses his abundant energies on where life is not powered by sunlight. These implications are taken a bit further, thanks to some dandy effects, on how life may develop in the ice-covered waters of Jupiter's moons. Some of the newly seen creatures are truly amazing: a fish with feet, shrimp that can swim between boiling hot steam and icy currents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirected by: James Cameron &amp; Steven Quale\n-----------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle: Aliens Of The Deep\nYear: 2005\nFile Size: 700 MB\nFormat:AVI\nVideo Length: 01:39:29\nVideo Codec: XviD\nVideo Resolution: 448x256\nVIdeo Bitrate: 984 kbit/s\nDisplay Aspect ratio: 16/9\nFPS: 23.976000\nAudio Bitrate: 448 kbit/s\nAudio Codec: (AC3)\nChannels: 6\nSubtitles: (N/A)\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0417415/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0417415/&lt;/a&gt;  \n\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures/images of all my torrents visit&quot; Suprbay Forum&quot; at   \n\nthis link: --------&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=18356&amp;page=10&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=18356&amp;page=10&lt;/a&gt;               \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the &quot;nfo&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           \n\n\n\n\n                          **** RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD ****\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98b2456994489f62b58e743505baefe4bc34f5f4","amp;dn":"Aliens+Of+The+Deep-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98b2456994489f62b58e743505baefe4bc34f5f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,178,69,105,148,72,159,98,181,142,116,53,5,186,239,228,188,52,245,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
