Basic human        \n           rights have become the rarest of luxuries. No one knows        \n           when this started but everyone knows how. The VXII, the        \n           deadliest virus ever created, spread like wildfire and         \n           decimated the majority of the world's population. The          \n           non-infected survivors now cling to life in four               \n           quarantined cities behind a wall. Shawn Kors and his           \n           brother, Jude, survived the VXII only to grow up in a          \n           squalid internment camp for orphaned children. Under the       \n           care of the militia, they were pitted against other            \n           children in backwoods death matches. Shawn, Jude, and the      \n           few who escaped became notorious for their incredible          \n           fighting skills. They have since parted ways. Shawn now        \n           makes a comfortable living as a janitor at the local           \n           medic station. He spends his days dreaming of curing the       \n           VXII. When Shawn discovers the discarded body of a fellow      \n           internment camp friend, he is forced out of hiding and         \n           pulled into a rabbit hole of conspiracy and violence. All      \n           signs point to Jude. With bounty hunters and the militia       \n           on his trail, Shawn races to find his brother before Jude      \n           executes an unspeakable action that will destroy them          \n           all. He chases Jude across a sprawling post-apocalyptic        \n           landscape to an abandoned laboratory. There he discovers       \n           the true nature of his world and the secret behind the         \n           white wall.                                                    \n                                                                          \n                                                    \n                        \n                            \n                                 \n                                                                          \n           James Boss................. : .................Shawn Kors      \n           Gary Kohn.................. : .....................Dryden      \n           Michael Teh................ : .................Jude Black      \n           Aurelie Kyinn.............. : ...................Elsa Lei      \n           John Klemantaski........... : ...............Dr. Eric Lei      \n           Hugh Mason................. : ...........Captain Troufeau      \n           Eddie Kaulukukui........... : .......................Kane      \n           Nevin Millan............... : ......................Vitor      \n           Walid Amini................ : ...................Sentenza      \n           Christopher Guyton......... : ................Apex Leader      \n           Gabriel Womack............. : .......................Pete      \n           Albert Marrero Jr.......... : .....................Apex 3      \n           Ping Lam Siu............... : ....................Ah Ping      \n           Joseph Tuccio.............. : ....................Janitor      \n           Philip Marlatt............. : ....................Medic 1      \n                                                                          \n                                                                      \n                      \n                             \n                       \n         \n                                                                        \n                                                                            \n                   Thanks to our friends at SADPANDA.
