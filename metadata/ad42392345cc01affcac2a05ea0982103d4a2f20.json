The painful  \n                    realisation that life is too short fuels his  \n                    determination to start a new life with Karen.  \n                    Karen is torn, but when Joe gives her a taste  \n                    of how their future could be she sets her  \n                    sights far away from Chatsworth. Trying to come  \n                    clean to Jamie, Karen's confession is derailed  \n                    when he reveals his own grubby secrets.  \n                    Emotional deadlock forces Joe into a course of  \n                    action with far-reaching consequences for all  \n                    of them. Elsewhere, Bruce gets a chance to  \n                    shine as caretaker/manager for the Jockey  \n                    football team, but when he arranges a gay  \n                    five-a-side football tournament Chesney is not  \n                    willing to 'come out' with the other lads. And  \n                    while Ian plays with the boys, Maxine decides  \n                    to explore her artistic side as a life model.  \n                                                         \n                                                                                                \n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                          RiPPERS NOTES:                           \n                                                                      \n\n                     \n                        Enjoy this great release from BiA\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                           GROUP NOTES:                            \n                                                                      \n\n                                   Greetz to \n\n                            FoV SFM TBS XiSO SAiNTS\n\n                            love your work boys ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad42392345cc01affcac2a05ea0982103d4a2f20","amp;dn":"Shameless.S07E15.HDTV.XviD-BiA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad42392345cc01affcac2a05ea0982103d4a2f20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,66,57,35,69,204,1,175,252,172,42,5,234,9,130,16,61,74,47,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
