Focusing mainly on just four of the Boys - John Lavery,\n      James Guthrie, George Henry and EA Hornel - she examines their\n      masterpieces in detail and charts their shifting friendships.\n      Following in the Boys' footsteps, Muriel travels through\n      Scotland and northern France to uncover the sources of their\n      inspiration and show just how radical their paintings were.\n      \n     \n                                                      Group Notes...\n        We are looking for:                           \n                                                                     \n      .EU Affil sites, NO COLO/RENTED.                              \n                                                                     \n      Retail TV dvds before the retail date.                        \n                                                                     \n      Can't get in contact with us?
