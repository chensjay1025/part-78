They turned themselves in and were released as heroes. They then see it as a calling by God and started knocking off mafia gang members one by one. Willem Dafoe plays the detective trying to figure out the killings, but the closer he was to catching the Irish brothers, the more he thinks the brothers are doing the right thing.\n\nIrish brothers Connor &amp; Murphy McManus live and work in Boston. Feeling that God's will to rid Earth from all human Evil was given to them as a mission, they set out to do their divine deed. A public outcry is never heard, and even FBI agent Paul Smecker, who follows their trace of bloodshed, admits that the boys are doing exactly what he secretly always has wished to happen. Risking their lives for their beliefs of Veritas (truth) and Aequitas (justice), the Boondock Saints are hyped by the public, for they are doing good, which only few dare to admit\n\n\nPLEASE SEED (KEEP THIS FILE OPEN ON YOUR COMPUTER TO OTHERS !)\t\t\n\n\n===========================================================================\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1c635086553df9f154f50cd482bc736fb567bf0","amp;dn":"The+Boondock+Saints+I+%5B1999%5D+AVI+VIDEO+Rel+by+CBCS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1c635086553df9f154f50cd482bc736fb567bf0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,198,53,8,101,83,223,159,21,79,80,205,72,43,199,54,251,86,123,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
