Mixbus &quot;True Analog Mixing&quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ provides critical mixing functions in a knob-per-function interface.  &quot;True Analog Mixing&quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ is based on Harrison's renowned 32-Series and MR-Series console designs, plus Harrison's proprietary digital mixing technology.  MixbusÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ enables you to record, edit, and mix a musical performance in-the-box while getting a sound that harkens back to the golden age of album recordings.\n\nTraditional DAW mixers were designed by companies with no pedigree in music mixing, and they suffer from well-known flaws. Harrison eliminated these flaws in Mixbus by completely replacing the DAW's internal mixing engine and applying proprietary True Analog processing. Harrison consoles are known for their great-sounding EQ, filters, dynamics, and bus summing on every track. Now Mixbus offers every engineer a real Harrison music console &quot;in the box&quot;. With Mixbus's logical knob-per-function interface, the user works with the fluidity of a traditional analog recording studio while retaining the convenience of a DAW.
