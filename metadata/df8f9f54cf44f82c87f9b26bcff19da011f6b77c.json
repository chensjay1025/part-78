Zenwalk Core is a one-of-a-kind complete 300 MB base Zenwalk system designed to build high-performance and high-security non-GUI Linux servers, or to be used as the base of a custom light-speed desktop system. It can be installed in just 10 minutes using the auto-install setup option on a dedicated disk. Zenwalk Core 6.4 provides the 2.6.33.4 kernel with the new BFS scheduler, designed for the best interactivity on multi-core CPUs while taking the most of lower specification machines. You'll notice better responsiveness of many applications, better real-time performance (very low latency), and efficiency of 'niced' commands.&quot;\n\nmd5sum : ee3e9d17f8262265127cad2d7b7a4202  zenwalk-core-6.4.iso","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df8f9f54cf44f82c87f9b26bcff19da011f6b77c","amp;dn":"zenwalk-core-6.4.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df8f9f54cf44f82c87f9b26bcff19da011f6b77c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,143,159,84,207,68,248,44,135,249,178,107,207,241,157,160,17,246,183,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
