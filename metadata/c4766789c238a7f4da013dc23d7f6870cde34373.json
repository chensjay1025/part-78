As fans of the great detective know, after retirement Holmes moved from London to Sussex, where he spent his days keeping bees. Chabon's story takes place during WWII, when Holmes is 89 and intent on bee-keeping until a mysterious boy wanders into town. The boy is remarkable for two reasons: he's clearly intelligent but is mute, and he keeps a parrot that mouths, among other utterances, numbers in German. \n\nWhen the parrot is stolen, local cops turn to Holmes, and he's intrigued enough to dust off his magnifying glass and go to work. The writing here is taut and polished, and Chabon's characters and depictions of English country life are spot on.\n\nRoused out of retirement, a former detective, now a beekeeper, is identified only as &quot;the old man.&quot; The story opens in the summer of 1944 when he sees a boy with a parrot on his shoulder walking along the train tracks. The boy is Linus Steinman, a refugee from Nazi Germany who lives with Mr. and Mrs. Panicker and their grown son in their boardinghouse. Though Linus doesn't speak, his parrot, Bruno, recites strings of numbers in German, as well as bits of poetry and snatches of songs. When a boarder is murdered and Bruno is kidnapped, the local police try to engage the beekeeper in helping them solve the crimes. He agrees to help, but only to find the bird. Thus begins his last case, his &quot;final solution.&quot; The double meaning of the title gives subtle layers to the story and reveals the man's deep compassion for Linus. Chabon's writing can be both startlingly clear or laced with intricacies and detours. One chapter is told from the point of view of the parrot. Readers will enjoy the realistic characters and lush descriptions, and, best of all, trying to figure out the mysteries. Even the identity of &quot;the old man&quot; is a mystery until they figure out the clues for themselvesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“the tweed suit, the pipe, the beekeeping, and the sharp mind that can only belong to one famous sleuth. \n\nCopyright Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. \nAll rights reserved.--This text refers to the Hardcover edition.\n\nFrom Bookmarks Magazine\nFrom his editorship of an issue of McSweeneyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s to his Pulitzer Prize-winning \nAmazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay, Chabon has mined genre fiction \nand pop culture in pursuit of literary gold. His newest novella finds \nhim polishing up the detective story as an unnamed Sherlock Holmes comes \nout of beekeeping retirement to work the case. Reviewers applaud the \nfresh approach Chabon takes with HolmesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ character, eschewing analytic \ngenius for emotional complexity. Critics labeled the titleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s reference \nto the Holocaust distasteful, but to be fair, it also ties to The Final \nProblem, the story in which Sherlock Holmes meets his apparent demise. \nThe plot appears compelling enough, but ChabonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s literary prose pushes \ncritics to a tipping point; some assert thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s more than just a gripping \nyarn at hand, while others question the combination of detectives, geopolitics, \nand ten-dollar words.\n\nCopyright Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© 2004 Phillips &amp; Nelson Media, Inc.--This text refers to \nthe Hardcover edition.\n\nFrom AudioFile\nWhile Chabon's novel of suspense is relatively short and Michael York \ndelivers a stellar performance, it's a challenge to the listener. The \nwork does not translate well to audio. Chabon is a master of complexity, \nboth in the stories he crafts and the style in which he writes. Although \nthese distinctions work well in print, in audio the listener does not \nhave the luxury of being able to turn back pages frequently to re-read \ncomplicated sentences. The result is an anomaly. Michael York could \nnot be better, and his style and tone fit well into a mystery based \nin the English countryside. But York's strengths simply cannot overcome \nChabon's complicated plot and narrative style, which are best enjoyed \nin print. D.J.S. Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© AudioFile 2005, Portland, Maine-- Copyright Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© AudioFile, \nPortland, Maine\n\nFrom Booklist\nFollowing Summerland (2002), his foray into fantasy, Chabon continues \nto tinker with genre fiction, this time with a peculiar homage to the \nclassical detective story. It's summer 1944: the Allies are slogging \ntheir way across France, and deep in the British countryside, a man \nis killed, apparently while in the act of stealing a German boy's parrot. \nThe boy, a seemingly mute Jewish refugee living with a melancholy African \nminister and his English wife, captures the interest of a long-retired \ndetective, once famous for his remarkable deductive abilities. Thus \nbegins a slow-moving but atmospheric evocation of the mood and feel \nof Christie and Sayers. Once roused from his reclusive retirement, our \nnameless, pipe-smoking, beekeeping hero proves every bit as eccentric \nand outlandishly brilliant as the classical-era detectives he evokes: \nHolmes, Poirot, Wimsey. Although Chabon patches together a serviceable \nplot--the murder victim may have been some sort of spy, and the number-spouting \nparrot may be hoarding a secret--he is less interested in constructing \na genuine puzzle than in assembling a cast of eccentrics and letting \nthem frolic in the countryside. It's all accomplished with plenty of \nsmart, stylistic turns, but finally the short novel feels like a lesser \nCoen brothers movie: all the trappings without much filling. That's \nthe trouble with genre homages: too often they turn out be Potemkin \nvillages. Bill Ott\nCopyright Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© American Library Association.

Into his life \nwanders Linus Steinman, nine years old and mute, who has escaped from \nNazi Germany with his sole companion: an African gray parrot. What is \nthe meaning of the mysterious strings of German numbers the bird spews \nout -- a top-secret SS code? The keys to a series of Swiss bank accounts \nperhaps? Or something more sinister? Is the solution to this last case \n-- the real explanation of the mysterious boy and his parrot -- beyond \neven the reach of the once-famed sleuth? Subtle revelations lead the \nreader to a wrenching resolution.\n\nThis brilliant homage is the work of a master storyteller at the height \nof his powers.\n\nPerformed by Michael York\n\n\nAbout the Author\n\nMichael Chabon is the bestselling and Pulitzer Prize-winning author \nof The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay, Werewolves in Their Youth, \nWonderboys, The Mysteries of Pittsburgh, Summerland (a novel for children), \nand The Final Solution. He lives in Berkeley, California, with his wife, \nthe novelist Ayelet Waldman, and their children.\n\n------------------------------------\nVisit us for this and loads more:\n\nwww.audiobookvault.com\n------------------------------------\n\n\nEnjoy!!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4766789c238a7f4da013dc23d7f6870cde34373","amp;dn":"The+Final+Solution+-+Michael+Chabon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4766789c238a7f4da013dc23d7f6870cde34373","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,118,103,137,194,56,167,244,218,1,61,194,61,127,104,112,205,227,67,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
