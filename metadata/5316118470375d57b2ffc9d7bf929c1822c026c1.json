The gamer will embark on territory seizure by means of especially designed units thus turning it into the principal energy resource. Then the subsequent encircling of the zones with an impenetrable perimeter will follow. Alongside unique terraforming and protecting perimeter opportunities the game provides powerful nanotechnologies, which allow managing groups of modifiable combat units. The necessity of efficient strategic territorial planning and tactical flexibility of combat units make the game appealing to any admirer of strategy genre.\n\nThe game takes place in a detailed science fiction universe and embraces an epic plot centered on the fate of Exodus civilization that once abandoned the dying Earth in search for a new world. The story leaves no sci-fi admirer indifferent and the gamer participates in a large-scale expedition covering several centuries in mysterious Pshychospere worlds. Perimeter does not copy other RTS products but instead offers a well-balanced combination of new terraforming principles and territorial wars with traditional strategy elements.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5316118470375d57b2ffc9d7bf929c1822c026c1","amp;dn":"Perimeter+%5BRU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5316118470375d57b2ffc9d7bf929c1822c026c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,22,17,132,112,55,93,87,178,255,201,215,191,146,156,24,34,192,38,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
