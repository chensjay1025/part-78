VLC Media Player is compatible on Windows (tested myself), just make sure you have the latest version.\nIt is not compatible with many devices.\n\n\nYou can use these to keep and save space on your hard drive.\n\nOriginal by: MGRT\nEncoded by: theviki\nRenamed by: theviki\nUploaded by: theviki\n\n\nHelp keep this torrent alive by seeding!\n\n\nEnjoy!\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5cb0eb58526df2462eea526d006e5c54d6e3f498","amp;dn":"%5Btheviki%5D+Ergo+Proxy+%5B1080p%5D+%5BHi10P%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5cb0eb58526df2462eea526d006e5c54d6e3f498","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,176,235,88,82,109,242,70,46,234,82,109,0,110,92,84,214,227,244,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
