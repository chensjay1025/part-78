The method used recreates the natural way you learned your first language, revealing skills that you already have. This approach has won numerous awards, and has been adopted by countless organizations, schools and millions of users around the world. Join the language revolution today. Only with Rosetta Stone.\n\nThe comprehensive language-learning solution that fits your life.\n\nLearn Naturally\nLearn your next language the same way you learned your first language. Dynamic Immersion empowers you to see, hear and comprehend without translating or memorizing. You already have this ability. Rosetta Stone simply unlocks it.\n\nEngage Interactively\nGet feedback to move forward. You learn best by doing, and you'll apply what you've learned to get to the next step. Rosetta Stone adapts to your individual needs and skills, because you drive the program with your progress.\n\nSpeak Confidently\nStart speaking immediately. From the very first lesson, you'll speak. You'll begin with essential basics, which form the building blocks of the language. Soon you'll create new sentences on your own, using words you've learned.\n\nHave Fun\nBest of all, Rosetta Stone is addictive. With every entertaining activity, you'll feel success. You'll want to use Rosetta Stone to have that next moment, that next breakthrough. So you'll keep using it, and you'll learn more!\n\nThat's language-learning success.\nThat's Rosetta Stone.\nNo translation or memorization required.\nThe most effective way to learn a new language is to be surrounded by it. When you were an infant, your parents taught you this way, by intuitively associating words with images. That's the ultimate language lab, but most language-learning programs completely ignore this.\n\nThink about all of the ways you've tried to learn a language: classes at school, tapes and cassettes, even software that uses your native language as a base for your next one. What do they all have in common? Translation and memorization.\n\nInstead of taking a &quot;direct flight&quot; from your brain to your new language, translation and memorization connects you to your old language. You always have to &quot;fly&quot; from your brain, to your native tongue ... and then translate what you've memorized to communicate.\n\nThat might work for a few words, but what happens when you get to a sentence or phrase? When you have to change tenses? You're going to make a lot of &quot;connecting flights.&quot; That's why those other methods are so frustrating ... and why they fail.\n\nEnter Dynamic Immersion.\nThis method encourages you to think like a baby. You'll pair words with vivid, real-life images and make connections between things you know and the new language. Soon, you'll be thinking in a new language, stringing words together into phrases that you create.\n\nInnovative technology.\nRosetta Stone places this Dynamic Immersion method at the core of a suite of software that works with you to develop your skills. The simple, intuitive interface helps to keep you engaged in the solution, while advanced speech recognition technology makes certain that you're speaking correctly and accurately. Best of all, Rosetta Stone never leaves you behind. You'll only move forward when you're ready, when you've become comfortable and confident.\n\nCommunicate and connect with the world: Level 1, 2 &amp; 3 Set.\nRosetta Stone Level 1, 2 &amp; 3 Set will take you on a journey from the basics to a whole new level of sophistication. You'll build a foundation of fundamental vocabulary and essential language structure. You'll quickly gain the confidence to engage in social interactions. Say &quot;hello&quot; and &quot;goodbye,&quot; arrange travel, order food, go shopping and more! From there, you'll share your ideas and opinions, express feelings and talk about your life, your interests and more. You'll discover a voice. In a new language.\n\nAudio Companion\nWith Audio Companion, you'll enhance the Rosetta Stone experience wherever you go. You'll learn new skills on the computer, and then reinforce what you've learned with Audio Companion. Simply play the CDs on a stereo or download them to a MP3 Player. Each Audio Companion activity corresponds to a lesson in the Rosetta Stone software, so you can turn your travel time into productive language-learning time\nKeygen Releaser\nno keygen\nDownload Size\n1.55 Gb\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSystem Requirements\n* Operating system: Windows (32-bit editions only) 2000, XP or Vista, Mac OS X 10.4 or 10.5\n* Processor: 1 GHz or faster processor speed\n* Memory: 512 RAM\n* Storage: 600 MB free hard-drive space (per level)\n* Sound: 16-bit sound card\n* Monitor: 800 x 600 display resolution (1024 x 768 recommended)\n* Internet connection: Internet or phone connection required for product activation\n* Additional peripherals: Speech Recognition feature requires a headset microphone (USB recommended)\n* Optical drive: 16X CD-ROM Drive (for installation)\n* Additional Requirements for Online Products\n* Internet connection: High-speed internet connection\n* Supported Browsers: Internet Explorer 6sp1, Internet Explorer 7, Firefox 2.0, Safari 2 and Safari 3\n* Additional Software: Flash 9 plug-in installed on browser\n* Note for Microsoft Windows Vista users: Current Rosetta Stone products have been engineered to install and run on the Windows Vista operating system.
