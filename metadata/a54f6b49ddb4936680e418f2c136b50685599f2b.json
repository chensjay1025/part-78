Inga, who escaped unnoticed in an apple tree, visiting King Rinkitink who had fallen in a well, and surly talking donkey Bilbil embark on a quest to save the Pingareeans.\n\nArmed only with three magic pearls that imbue strength, invincibility, and wisdom, the three take on the open sea, the military might of the islands of Regos and Coregos, and the Nome King.\n(Summary by Scott Sherris)\n\nThis is a no rights reserved audio book read by volunteers from librivox.org.
