The album was released on July 17, 2007 in the United States via Universal Republic, debuting at #5 on the Billboard 200 and selling 51,000 copies in the first week.[2] The album was certified 2x Platinum by the RIAA with shipments to U.S. retailers of 2,000,000 units.[3] The album's first single was &quot;Bubbly&quot;, the second was &quot;Realize&quot;, and the third was &quot;The Little Things&quot; it became the final single from the album in the United States. According to one of the pictures on Caillat's MySpace page, it was assumed that her song &quot;Battle&quot; would have been the fourth and final single from Coco. Because of her collaboration with Jason Mraz, &quot;Lucky&quot;, being released as a single and with the release of her second album, it is assumed that the single and music video were canceled and all promotion was then focused on &quot;Lucky&quot; and her second album Breakthrough.[4] It also became Caillat's best-selling album, to date, selling 2,000,000 copies in the United States and over 3,000,000 million on world. Caillat supported the album with the Coco World Tour.\n\nTrack listing\nNo. \tTitle \t                Writer(s) \t                Length\n1. \t&quot;Oxygen&quot;   \t        Colbie Caillat, Jason Reeves \t3:51\n2. \t&quot;The Little Things&quot;   \tCaillat, Reeves \t        3:45\n3. \t&quot;One Fine Wire&quot;   \tMikal Blue, Caillat, Reeves \t3:36\n4. \t&quot;Bubbly&quot;   \t        Caillat, Reeves \t\t3:16\n5. \t&quot;Feelings Show&quot;   \tBlue, Caillat, Reeves \t\t3:09\n6. \t&quot;Midnight Bottle&quot;   \tCaillat, Reeves \t\t3:40\n7. \t&quot;Realize&quot;   \t        Blue, Caillat, Reeves \t\t4:05\n8. \t&quot;Battle&quot;   \t        Blue, Caillat \t\t\t4:04\n9. \t&quot;Tailor Made&quot;   \tCaillat, Reeves \t\t4:29\n10. \t&quot;Magic&quot;   \t        Caillat, Reeves \t\t3:24\n11. \t&quot;Tied Down&quot;         \tCaillat, Reeves \t\t3:06\n12. \t&quot;Capri&quot;   \t        Caillat \t\t\t2:57","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00bd46511a5855362e4f74c13713e29320c1d5f7","amp;dn":"Colbie+Caillat+-+Coco+%5B2007%5D+%5BEAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00bd46511a5855362e4f74c13713e29320c1d5f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,189,70,81,26,88,85,54,46,79,116,193,55,19,226,147,32,193,213,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
