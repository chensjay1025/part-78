This book - which runs to over 600 pages, but nonetheless makes for fascinating reading - covers the period from 1951 to 1957. The producers have picked 5 extracts covering such things as the Festival of Britain and the Coronation. A good introduction to this fascinating book.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:025a8dc88aed605e508a8ad8b142796555651045","amp;dn":"Family+Britain+-+Radio+Adaptation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"025a8dc88aed605e508a8ad8b142796555651045","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,90,141,200,138,237,96,94,80,138,138,216,177,66,121,101,85,101,16,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
