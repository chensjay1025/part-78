Right click on the file your downloading and select &quot;show details&quot;\n\n2. Then click on &quot;files&quot; tab in the detailed window\n\n3. Right click on the file(s) you don't want and move your cursor over &quot;set priority&quot; and select &quot;delete&quot; or &quot;do not download&quot;\n\n4. If you want a game more than an other go to &quot;set priority&quot; and click &quot;high&quot;\n\n\n\nOnce I have 100+ seeders I will upload the next collection\n\n\n\n    I've been seeding since day 1 and i still am. You should seed as much as you download. If you download this whole file, upload it all back. if you only downloaded 2-3 games upload as much you downloaded them for. If we can get seeders eventually we can make this torrent last forever. If everyone seeded this file when they complete we could have LOTS of seeders and if we have LOTS of seeders, people could download this really fast and become a seeder sooner. \nWouldn't it be awesome to say &quot;I want to play this game&quot; then go to thepiratebay,ifile.it,radipshare, hot file, console trends etc without worrying it might not exist here? I've searched for every decent game and atleast 10% of them i couldn't find and 10% had 0 seeders. If you seed my &quot;best of&quot; torrents we wouldn't need to worry about that! SEED AND MAKE SURE OUR PSP LIBRARY DOESN'T DISAPPEAR!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58128286860269e190a7b54955c68a31cc25ffe2","amp;dn":"%7CPSP%7C+Best+Shooters+On+The+PSP+%28Select+Game%29+%7CArvenian%7C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58128286860269e190a7b54955c68a31cc25ffe2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,18,130,134,134,2,105,225,144,167,181,73,85,198,138,49,204,37,255,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
