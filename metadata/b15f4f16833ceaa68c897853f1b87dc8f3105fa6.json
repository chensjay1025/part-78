Have fun.\n\nSimple as that.\n\nYou will start out with the stats I had at the time of upload, sorry if that causes a problem for you (if you wanted to start fresh).  \nThe stats aren't very high, but it is still a little bonus if you don't care if you get my stats.\n\nAlso, at the time of the upload, my name was 'Thunderhorse' and I forgot to delete it before making the torrent.  If you wish to change it. Simply open up the folder where you extracted the game to, and open 'rev'.  It shouldn't be in any folder, and it is a notepad file.  Once open change the steamuser and playername to whatever you want.\n\nPlease seed.  I will seed as long as necessary.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHere is a link to having all level 6 perks.\nGood to use when you have a group of friends wanting to play on suicidal difficulty.\nNot my torrent so all credit goes to, Tyrfi. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5421173/All_Killing_Floor_Lvl_6_perks&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5421173/All_Killing_Floor_Lvl_6_perks&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b15f4f16833ceaa68c897853f1b87dc8f3105fa6","amp;dn":"Killing+Floor+Version+1011.2+Nosteam+w%2F+Defense+Alliance+Mod","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b15f4f16833ceaa68c897853f1b87dc8f3105fa6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,95,79,22,131,60,234,166,140,137,120,83,241,184,125,200,243,16,95,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
