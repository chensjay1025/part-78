That said, here's the info found on Amazon.                                                                                                                                                          Spike &amp; MikeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Cutting Edge Classics: Favorites From The Classic Festival Of Animation is an amazing collection of audacious, wildly original animated shorts from the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most promising animators. Each work is a stunning blend of comedy and pathos, challenging the boundaries of both genre and form. These groundbreaking shorts raise the bar for all animated films to follow.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ While the wildly popular Sick &amp; Twisted series (Full Frontal and Unprotected!) contains material for adults only, this collection is appropriate for a wider audience, albeit not children. The content is mild and the focus is on the art of the animation. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ This is the first &quot;Best Of&quot; DVD issue of the Classic Animation festival, featuring top international and local animation.\n\nContents:\n1. An Old Story (1:20) Zohar Shahar\n2.
