Yes Millie Jackson...you remember her as the woman who made those BLUE LIGHT albums that only your parents listened to and you dared not touch even so much as the album cover. Lol\n\nMs. Keisha Jackson made two incredible albums during her musical career and now does mostly behind the scenes work. Her MATURE LOVE track did very well using the NEW JACK SOUND of the 90s and a slick video that put Ms. Jackson on the map (You can look on YouTube for the video of MATURE LOVE from Keisha to see what I mean). The rest of the album was well produced and there is not one track that is not absolutely likeable. Listen adn hear for yourself and have that flashback of how good the early nineties were given the fashion, haircuts, dances and good times...\n\nHere is the discography of Keisha Jackson. I would suggest listening to the 1991 album first, it is hits from front to back and please remember to seed seed seed to keep the music alive and above all enjoy and share those artists/music that you may have that is not on TPB.\n\n1991 Album Include:\n\nKeisha Jackson 1991 - Mature Love\nKeisha Jackson 1991 - Momma Told Me\nKeisha Jackson 1991 - How I Wonder\nKeisha Jackson 1991 - My Happiness\nKeisha Jackson 1991 - Love Don't Walk Away Featuring Eric Gable\nKeisha Jackson 1991 - I Won't Forget you\nKeisha Jackson 1991 - God Send\nKeisha Jackson 1991 - Feel You Out\nKeisha Jackson 1991 - Call Me\nKeisha Jackson 1991 - All Night Lovin\nKeisha Jackson 1991 - All Night Lovin Interlude\n\n\n1989 album Include:\n\nKeisha Jackson 1989 - Hot Little Love Affair\nKeisha Jackson 1989 - Do Me Right\nKeisha Jackson 1989 - He's SO Jealous\nKeisha Jackson 1989 - U Need Lover\nKeisha Jackson 1989 - U.B.U\nKeisha Jackson 1989 - Over You\nKeisha Jackson 1989 - Love Triangle\nKeisha Jackson 1989 - After All This Time\nKeisha Jackson 1989 - Look Out For Number One\nKeisha Jackson 1989 - Hit Me (With Your Love)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05e5c4dd009aaa4cefc6a5905d8c56477f44f1db","amp;dn":"KEISHA+JACKSON+DISCOGRAPHY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05e5c4dd009aaa4cefc6a5905d8c56477f44f1db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,229,196,221,0,154,170,76,239,198,165,144,93,140,86,71,127,68,241,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
