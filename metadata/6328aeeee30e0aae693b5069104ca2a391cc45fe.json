Dr. Ira Leifer is an expert hired by the government to estimate the rate of the oil flow.  As the Times reports, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDr. Leifer said in an interview on Monday that judging from the video, cutting the pipe might have led to a several-fold increase in the flow rate from the well. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“The well pipe clearly is fluxing way more than it did before . . . By way more, I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t mean 20 percent, I mean multiple factors.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nOh dear, is it possible that BP is (gasp!) lying about the scope of the disaster, trying to minimize it or something? Have you noticed that every ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œfixÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ they attempt seems to make things worse?  At this point would it not make sense to order them out of the Gulf and let some fresh, non-BP-affiliated experts have a shot?  CanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t imagine they would do a worse job.\n\nWeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll discuss this ongoing nightmare, the environmental and economic implications, the primary election results, and chat with Laura Flanders on the program tonight!  DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t miss a minute of the non-stop fun and frivolity, call 877-996-2556!\n\nOh, remember the Rabbi who played ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œgotchaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ with Helen Thomas?  Think he may be racist?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6328aeeee30e0aae693b5069104ca2a391cc45fe","amp;dn":"Mike+Malloy+Show+-+June+08+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6328aeeee30e0aae693b5069104ca2a391cc45fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,40,174,238,227,14,10,174,105,59,80,105,16,76,162,163,145,204,69,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
