He belongs to a redundant      \n    generation, eclipsed by a fast-paced, elitist society that is            \n    mesmerized with education and status. Harry desires to leave the         \n    antiseptic streets of Singapore for his paradise on earth in Western     \n    Australia. His attempt to migrate is complicated when he takes on a      \n    job ferrying prostitutes. This evokes painful memories from his past.    \n    When he takes an unhealthy interest in a Vietnamese prostitute, it       \n    awakens a dark and dangerous attempt at personal redemption. The film    \n    tackles an extremely topical issue of emigration in Singapore. It is     \n    peppered by denizens of the underbelly of Singapore society,             \n    reflecting the multicultural idiosyncrasies of a seemingly pristine      \n    city. More importantly, it is a personal journey of a flawed man in a    \n    society that does not tolerate failure. As such, Harry s rant and        \n    anger - directed at anyone and anything, but himself - is merely a       \n    distraction from his own feelings of impotency within society, and       \n    his inability to find redemption from his past.                          \n                                                                             \n    Ripper Notes:                                                            \n    NTSC DVD with 25fps output.
