Mainstream media sources have recently attempted to paint a false picture of the FSA and Al-Qaeda as being divided. \n\nIn order to really emphasize Obama's continued suffocation of small business owners, Alex talks to top children's magician Marty Hahne, better known as Marty the Magician. Recently, the U.S. Department of Agriculture forced Marty to get a license for the rabbit that he pulls out of his hat. Now the Obama Administration wants Marty to also submit a 32-page &quot;disaster plan&quot; for the rabbit.  \n\nNightly News host David Knight comes in studio to announce the second place winner of Operation Paul Revere.\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential \n to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a\n spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the &quot;big \n picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media \n for news and info is a prescription for ignorance.
