With hook laden, powerful music and an       |\n|  incredible stage show, itÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s no wonder that Ember has begun to ignite.     |\n|  Since their inception, Ember has performed across the US including        |\n|  California, New York, Texas, Kansas, and Oklahoma. They released an       |\n|  independent EP Under Pressure in 2006, produced by Sylvia Massy Shivy     |\n|  (Deftones, Tool, Red Hot Chili Peppers) at Radiostar studios in Weed,     |\n|  California. Shortly after, Ember signed with The Price Agency under the   |\n|  direction of J. Price. Following that union, the band started to flash    |\n|  all over the radar, playing shows with major mainstream acts such as      |\n|  Blue October, Theory of a Deadman, and Black Stone Cherry. Ember quickly  |\n|  became one of the top requested bands on internet radio and gained        |\n|  endorsements from Rock Revival Jeans, Incredible Ears, Gibson, Mesa       |\n|  Boogie, Sabian, and many others. After becoming a member of Armed Forces  |\n|  Entertainment, Ember scored the main support slot for multi-platinum      |\n|  rock powerhouse Hinder, and was then asked to headline the Fall tour in   |\n|  September of 2009.                                                        |\n|                                                                            |\n+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1562e2536c70f855da07fb399bb1363e05c034f","amp;dn":"Ember+-+Embrace+%5B2010%5D+-+GovoGrave","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1562e2536c70f855da07fb399bb1363e05c034f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,86,46,37,54,199,15,133,93,160,127,179,153,187,19,99,224,92,3,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
