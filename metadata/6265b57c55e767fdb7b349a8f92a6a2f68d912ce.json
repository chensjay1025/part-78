Shortly before the album's release, the band's only single was released, a 7&quot; maxi single (playing at 33/3rpm) with three tracks on it: an alternative take of 'Diana' (the album's opening track), and two other tracks which weren't included on the album.  This torrent also contains an outtake from this session ('All the Colours of Darkness') which has never before been released.\n\nThe group disbanded after the first album, but re-formed three years later for a second album &quot;To Keep From Crying&quot;.  Three of the band's original 6 members had left, and 2 new members joined.  This second album  was not as successful, and is not as highly-regarded as the first, and the group once again disbanded.\n\nRoger Wootton (the driving force behind the band's two albums) released a solo 7&quot; single in 1974.  Although not a work of Comus, this is included here too.\n\n== about this torrent:\n\nThis torrent contains the complete 2005 CD re-issue &quot;Song To Comus: The Complete Collection&quot;, including the cover scans of that release; and also extra cover scans of all original releases.\n\nI have re-ordered the tracks into folders in this torrent, so that all the material is chronological, and grouped as per original release.  I have re-numbered the files in their new folders accordingly.  But I have not altered the tags (which contain the reissued two CDs' track order), in case people wish to print the reissue covers and burn a CD.\n\nCover scans of the original releases of all material are included inside each individual folder.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6265b57c55e767fdb7b349a8f92a6a2f68d912ce","amp;dn":"Comus-Diana%2CFirst+Utterance%281971%29%2CTo+Keep+From+Crying%281974%29%28mp3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6265b57c55e767fdb7b349a8f92a6a2f68d912ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,101,181,124,85,231,103,253,183,179,73,168,249,42,106,47,104,217,18,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
