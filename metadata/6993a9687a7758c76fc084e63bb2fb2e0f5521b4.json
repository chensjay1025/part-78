This is actually a video of the game client, but since there's little gameplay in it, I decided to label it as a &quot;tech demo&quot;. It demonstrates an Earth-like planet with a ring, seamless transitions, a little spaceship ( the &quot;Hornet&quot; for those who remember ), a space station and a couple of new effects.&quot;\n\nAll Credit to Flavien Brebion and the Infinity Team.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6993a9687a7758c76fc084e63bb2fb2e0f5521b4","amp;dn":"Infinity%2FI-Novae+Tech+Demo+Video+01%2F05%2F2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6993a9687a7758c76fc084e63bb2fb2e0f5521b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,147,169,104,122,119,88,199,111,192,132,230,59,178,251,46,15,85,33,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
