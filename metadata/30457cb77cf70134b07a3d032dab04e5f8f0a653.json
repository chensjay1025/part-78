After eight years serving the U.S. Army Special Forces, Sergeant Chris Vaughn returns to his hometown seeking for a job in the local mill. He is informed by Sheriff Stan Watkins that the mill was closed six months ago and now the Wild Cherry Casino, owned by his former high school friend Jay Hamilton, is the major source of jobs and income to the town. Chris goes home, and meets his best-friend Ray Templeton, who organized a football game with their friends. After the game, Jay invites Chris and his friends to spend the night in his casino on him, but when Chris finds that the casino stick-man is cheating with the dices, he fights against the security men and is almost killed by them. When his nephew Pete has an OD with amphetamines sold by the security men of the casino, Chris realizes that the town is dominated by the mobsters and the corrupt sheriff and with a huge piece of wood, he breaks the casino and the criminals. He is prosecuted and in the trial, he promises to the jury and to the population that if he is considered non-guilty, he would be candidate to the sheriff position and clean the town. Later, Sheriff Chris Vaughn has to fight against the organized crime to keep his promise.\nGenre: Action |\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nThis file will play on the following list.\n\n* PC ----- PowerDVD, VLC Media Player\n* MAC ----- Roxio Toast Video Player, VLC Media Player\n* PS3 ----- Direct from External HD or streaming using a Media Server such as PS3 Media Sever\n* X-box 360 ----- Windows 7 and streaming on the network through Windows Media Center\n\nSpecifications\n\n* Codec ----- H.264\n* Resolution ----- 1920x1080\n* Bitrate ----- 6.0 Mbps\n* Frame Rate ----- 24 fps\n* Audio ----- AC3 Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround (640Kb)\n* Language ----- English\n* Subtitles ----- None\n* Aspect Ratio ----- 2.35:1\n* Source ----- Blu-Ray\n\nProcedure and Testing\n\n* This file is kept under 4GB for easy storage (Dang FAT32!)\n* Hi quality 2-pass H.264 standard encoding\n* Tested on Sony PS3 Firmware 3.21\n* Tested on Samsung 750s 120hz 52ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ LCD\n\n\n* Screens:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/image/15000/14253.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/image/15000/14253.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30457cb77cf70134b07a3d032dab04e5f8f0a653","amp;dn":"Walking+Tall+1080p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30457cb77cf70134b07a3d032dab04e5f8f0a653","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,69,124,183,124,247,1,52,176,122,61,3,45,171,4,229,248,240,166,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
