Van Eatons energetic drumming,\n\n\nRay Charles (September 23, 1930 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ June 10, 2004) was an American musician. \nCharles was a pioneer in the genre of soul music during the 1950s by fusing rhythm &amp; blues, gospel, and blues styles into his early recordings for Atlantic Records.\nHe also helped racially integrate country and pop music during the 1960s with his \ncrossover success on ABC Records, most notably with his Modern Sounds albums.\n\nDuring his tenure with ABC, Charles became one of the first African-American \nmusicians to be given artistic control by a mainstream record company.\n\n\nKim Carnes (born July 20, 1945, Hollywood, California) is an American singer-\nsongwriter, she is a two-time Grammy Award winner, noted for her distinctive, raspy\nvocal style.\n\nBette Davis Eyes is a song made popular by American singer-songwriter, Kim Carnes.\n\nThe song was written in 1974 by Donna Weiss and Jackie DeShannon. DeShannon recorded the song that same year on her album New Arrangement, but it was not until 1981, when Kim Carnes recorded her version of the song, that it became a commercial success.\n\nThe Kim Carnes recording of the song spent nine non-consecutive weeks on top of the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 (interrupted for one week by the Stars on 45 Medley), and over eight million copies of the album on which the song appeared, Mistaken Identity, were sold. The single went on to become the highest seller of the year and won the Grammy Awards for Song of the Year and \nRecord of the Year. \nThe song was also a number one hit in 31 countries, including Germany, Australia, Switzerland, Italy, Norway, Japan, and Brazil, but it achieved more moderate success in the UK Singles Chart, peaking at number ten. \n__________\n\nVOLUME TWO\n\n 1.
