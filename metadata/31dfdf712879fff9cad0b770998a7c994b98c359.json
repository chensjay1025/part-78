It would be God creating a kind of puppet show down here...I think evolution is the way that novelty and new kinds of experiences and the unknown are designed to arise out of creation to make this a very interesting place,&quot; Haisch put forth. \n\n\nWhile there may be multiverses or alternate universes, Haisch believes that it is just one intelligence that is expressing itself in different ways. Further, he suggested that the purpose of the universe is for the consciousness of God to enter into existing life forms and experience physical reality. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChildhood Obesity\n\n\n\nFirst hour guests, Jay Snaric and Kimberly Hickman talked about childhood obesity, and their program to combat it, Build a Plate. The problem has tripled in the last decade, with one out of three kids, now obese or overweight, they detailed. Among the tips they shared were &quot;5 Foods You Should Never Feed Your Child:&quot; soda, fruit juice, white rice, white bread, and white pasta. \n\n\nWebsite(s):\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢thegodtheory.com\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢build-a-plate.com\nBook(s):\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢The Purpose-Guided Universe: Believing In Einstein, Darwin, and God\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢The God Theory","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31dfdf712879fff9cad0b770998a7c994b98c359","amp;dn":"Coast+to+Coast+AM+-+06-06-10+-+God+%26+Universal+Intelligence","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31dfdf712879fff9cad0b770998a7c994b98c359","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,223,223,113,40,121,255,249,202,208,183,112,153,138,124,153,75,152,195,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
