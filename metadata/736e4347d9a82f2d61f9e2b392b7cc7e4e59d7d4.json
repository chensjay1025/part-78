The song reached #33 on the UK Singles Chart in 1986.\n\nBelouis Some (born Neville Keighley, 12 December 1959), is a British New Wave musician. He had a few minor hits  in the 1980s with &quot;Some People&quot;, &quot;Round and Round&quot;, (produced by Bernard Edwards, which appeared on the soundtrack album to the film Pretty in Pink), plus &quot;Imagination&quot;, which reached #17 on the UK Singles Chart and which can be heard in the movies Ghost Chase and The Business. &quot;Some People&quot; and &quot;Imagination&quot; also charted on the U.S.  Billboard Hot 100 in 1985.\n\nBorn Neville Keighley, Some released his first LP, Some People, in 1985. The title track was a club hit. Although Some's contribution to the Pretty in Pink soundtrack, &quot;Round, Round&quot;, did not penetrate the mainstream, it introduced him to an audience outside of discothÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨ques. Produced by Bernard Edwards, &quot;Round, Round&quot; included an electric guitar rock sound while also featuring a dance groove. &quot;Imagination,&quot; a song from Some People, was reissued in 1986, peaking at number 17 on the U.K. pop charts. Both &quot;Some People&quot; and &quot;Imagination&quot; were remixed several times. In 1986 he appeared at Knebworth at the bottom of a bill including Queen, Big Country, and Status Quo, where audience members threw plastic bottles at him. In 1987, Some recorded his self-titled second album, but it failed to duplicate the success of his debut. Some then disappeared from the music scene, until 1993 when he released Living Your Life with a techno sound. He has since made sporadic appearances under the alternate pseudonym  Belouis Many.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:736e4347d9a82f2d61f9e2b392b7cc7e4e59d7d4","amp;dn":"Belouis+Some+-+Some+People++%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"736e4347d9a82f2d61f9e2b392b7cc7e4e59d7d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,110,67,71,217,168,47,45,97,249,226,179,146,183,204,126,78,89,215,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
