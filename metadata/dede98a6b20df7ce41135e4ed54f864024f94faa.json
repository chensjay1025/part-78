The answer is soon discovered in the ancient language of the Navajo. Enlisted into the Marine Corps are several &quot;Windtalkers&quot; who are deployed to frontline areas in the Pacific, to use their language as an impossible-to-crack secret code. A drawback, however, is that the U.S. military soon puts forth a directive that the Windtalkers must never be captured alive by the enemy, so additional Marines are assigned to make certian that this directive is carried out to the letter.
