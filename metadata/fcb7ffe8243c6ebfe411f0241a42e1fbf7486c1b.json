As the name implies, this isn't a normal racing game; players will have to watch out for environmental hazards like lava and boulders while guarding against homing missiles, attack drones, and other weapons unleashed by the other racers. The story of JAK X weaves together several different plots that began in the previous games. Krew, a villain from JAK II, is dead, and Jak and Dexter are asked to attend the reading of his will along with Sig, Ashelin, Krew's daughter Rayn, and others. One of Krew's requests is that everyone drink a toast in his honor; however, the wine is poisoned The rest of Krew's instructions are then revealed: if any of the characters can win the Kras City Grand Championship in his name, they will be given the antidote. With no choice in the matter, the group enters the race, but soon, each is vying to win no matter what. The game features four different cups consisting of 20 challenges each, plus a large number of unlockable extras like more tracks, car upgrades, new racers, and more. Different weapons and abilities are available on each track, allowing players to fire lasers and create oil slicks to stop their opponents. JAK X: COMBAT RACING will keep players on their toes as they attempt to win the race and the antidote.\n\n\nDo you missing a game?
