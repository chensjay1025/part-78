Island vibes gun mek yu woofers melt. My first share.... I'm hoping all is right. Covers included. Enjoy!\n\nThe heavy dub sounds of The Big Bass Theory resonate with the deep bass &amp; drums of a Jamaican thunder storm. This ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“creation equationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ is rooted in solid riddims with serious bass frequencies. The music uplifts the soul with positive sound. Repleate with soaring horns, steady bubble and skank, and stellar percussion, the music is dubbed-out with multiple delays, analogue effects and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“old-schoolÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ mixing techniques. The bass-lines are massive and the modern beats are original and moving, with a definite dancehall feel and reggae groove.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d4e459be13d81ed3bee71a3965d6f33d58454ae","amp;dn":"Big+Bass+Theory-+Dub+Universe%282007%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d4e459be13d81ed3bee71a3965d6f33d58454ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,78,69,155,225,61,129,237,59,238,113,163,150,93,111,51,213,132,84,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
