April 30, 2010\n\n\nWill Owsley (c.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â°1965 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ April 30, 2010), known professionally as simply Owsley, was an American singer-songwriter, who worked as the guitarist in Amy Grant's touring band, but whose own albums won critical acclaim and one Grammy Award nomination. He was also a recording engineer and record producer.\n\nOwsley played guitar from an early age. He was a fan of Kiss and of Todd Rundgren, but mostly practiced Eddie Van Halen licks note-for-note. With his father's mentorship, he played snare drum in his high school marching band, but he also continued his passion for guitar, playing in a jazz and top-40 cover band at local venues. Later, when he began writing his own songs, they were more similar to the style of The Beatles. As a guitarist, he also cited influences such as Chet Atkins and Robert Johnson.\n\n\n\n\nFILES IN THIS DISCOGRAPHY:\n\n- Owsley - Coming Up Roses (EP)(1999)\n\n- Owsley - Live @ WRLT-FM Nashville Sunday Night (May 9 2004)\n\n- Owsley - Owsley (1999)\n\n- Owsley - The Hard Way (2004)\n\n- The Semantics - Powerbill (1993)\n\n- Extras\n\n\nENJOY &amp; REMEMBER TO KEEP SEEDING AFTER DOWNLOADING!!\nTHANKS!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e303f77c5f6f71e14a7ec156dddc313b966dbf1","amp;dn":"%28Will%29+Owsley+Discography+%28Semantics+%26+Solo%29%28Plus+Bonus+Live+%26+E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e303f77c5f6f71e14a7ec156dddc313b966dbf1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,48,63,119,197,246,247,30,20,167,236,21,109,221,195,19,185,102,219,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
