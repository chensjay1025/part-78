It's a fabulous recording for such a modest facility and effort.\n\nReleased under the band name Justin James &amp; Co., the songwriter tracked the collection at Plowground Productions, the studio run by local drummer Jim Donnelly. Banjo player/guitarist Bailey Horsley and upright bassist Tom Propst contributed most of the backing parts. Burke and Donnelly arranged for Nashville studio man Kevin Mixson (of Mix 7 Studios) to master the songs. They did a nice job. Most of the tunes amble by like shimmering patches of fog: wispy, lilting, and mysterious.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe swingin' but dozy &quot;In the Garden&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ propelled by a melodic, rolling banjo line from Horsley ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ kicks things off with a strummy rhythm with light piano and distorted guitar accents percolating in the background as Burke sings of his &quot;rose bush burning red.&quot; It's a solid opener that swells, builds momentum, and dissipates dynamically.\n\nHarmony-heavy ballad &quot;The Rescue&quot; crescendoes with even noisier guitar feedback in the distant background. Featuring Ben Bridwell (of Band of Horses) on the high-note backing vocals, plus a touch of extra brass on a few breaks, Burke sings like a gracious survivor from verse to verse.\n\nThe bluegrass-based &quot;Count on Me&quot; bounces with a quicker tempo, with terrific mandolin and banjo work. Think Cat Stevens meets the Pure Prairie League. The most Woodstock-styled song of the bunch, &quot;Free Love,&quot; is a bit more anthemic. Optimistic and gracious, with banjo, acoustic and electric guitar, and bits of electric piano, the highlight is the chorus of &quot;If you feel love, feel love ... if you feel free, feel free.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n&quot;I Know You Will,&quot; one of the twangiest ditties, has some of the warmest vocal harmonies, the catchiest melodies, and the most Keith Richards-esque guitar solo of the collection (thanks to Mike Sivilli and Dan Lotti, the guest guitarists from Dangermuffin).\n\nThe sad, waltzy &quot;Just a Dream&quot; slows things down considerably with a double-fiddle intro. The album's anthemic closer &quot;Chaser Boy&quot; finds Burke singing &quot;Hallelujah!&quot; as if he were among the congregation at Sunday services.\n\nBurke's words stick in the mind. Lyrically, Southern Son, So Far conjures familiar childhood memories and images ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ set against an appealingly woodsy/rootsy sound. Tastefully sparse at times, Burke sings from the heart without hesitation or worry. It's an impressive and strong step ahead for the budding local songwriter.\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.
