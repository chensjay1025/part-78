Also, this was the first BtBaM song I ever heard, I saw the video clip on an episode of VictoryTV.\n\nSelkies: The Endless Obsession. For a long time, before I actually really got into them, this was my favorite song, I'd listen to it at least once a day. The harmonies in the intro are breathtaking, the heaviness they pound out through the verse is brutal and dissonnant without going over the top, then the return to that tasty opening riff and then one of the most beautifully written musical pieces I've ever heard. With the perfect balance of beauty and technicality, this is surely the best track on the album.\n\nLaser Speed is almost a practical joke on the listeners, first you're listening to a relaxing jazz acoustic number, and then it takes a nosedive headfirst into a textbook elevator music stereotypical laid-back jam\n\n**************\nThe Anatomy Of\n**************\nGenre: Metal\nYear: 2006\nTime: 1:09:57\n**********\nTracklist\n\n01 | Blackened               [244kbps]\n02 | Kickstart My Heart      [256kbps]\n03 | The Day I Tried To Live [160kbps]\n04 | Bicycle Race            [256kbps]\n05 | Three Of A Pair         [256kbps]\n06 | - Missing Track\n07 | Geek U.S.A.
