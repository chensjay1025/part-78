So I just went out and bought it (I love roguelikes, yeah). Definitely a throwback to 16-bit days. The quote below kinda sums it up a-ok... The Legend Of Zelda+The Binding Of Isaac, mhmm.\n--------------------------------------\n\nDescription:\n&quot;Combining its own unique take on the real-time roguelike genre, with a nostalgic 16-bit look and feel; Diehard Dungeon is a game that feels both familiar and quite different at the same time, &quot;occupying a curious middle ground between The Legend of Zelda and The Binding of Isaac&quot;.\n\nFollowed by a trusty, treasure collecting companion chest, the player must make their way through the dungeons many randomly-generated rooms and levels. Armed with a sword and a Ã¢â‚¬Ëœhand cannonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, all manner of nasty dungeon dwellers, bosses and traps will need to be defeated or traversed in order to emerge from the dungeon victorious!\nTo aid them in their quest, the player may be lucky enough to encounter one or more upgrades, or new abilities, scattered throughout the dungeon.\nA randomly generated dungeon is created every playthrough. Discover the dungeons many secrets and multiple outcomes.\nDo you have what it takes to survive the dungeon? \n-Refurbish valuable antiques\n-Turn a tidy profit\n-Go on a treasure hunt\n\nVideo:\n\nSystem Requirements:\nOS: Windows XP / Vista / 7\nProcessor: 1.8Ghz\nRAM: 256MB\nFree hard drive space: 100 MB\nVideo Card: DirectX 9.0c compatible\nController: Full XInput controller support\n\n\n--------------------------------------\n*Absolutely 100% clean and working!*\n*My upload ain't the best, but I'll seed this forever!*\n*BUY the games you reallllly dig!!!*\n\nIndie Video Game OSTs:","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd4b4f1230b3d6b94bf93b94e05e3bd7823ee56f","amp;dn":"Diehard+Dungeon+1.3.5+%28roguelike%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd4b4f1230b3d6b94bf93b94e05e3bd7823ee56f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,75,79,18,48,179,214,185,75,249,59,148,224,94,59,215,130,62,229,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
