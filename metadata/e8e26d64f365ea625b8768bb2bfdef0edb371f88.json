Already a bestseller around the world - now reissued in striking new cover style. Maggie Bradford is on trial for murder - in the celebrity trial of the decade. As one of the world's best-loved singer-songwriters, she seems to have it all. So how could she have murdered not just one, but two of her husbands? Will Shepherd was Maggie's second husband. A magnificent athlete and film star, he was just as famous. But Will had dark, dangerous secrets that none of his fans could have imagined...that his own wife could never have dreamed of.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8e26d64f365ea625b8768bb2bfdef0edb371f88","amp;dn":"Hide+and+Seek+by+James+Patterson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8e26d64f365ea625b8768bb2bfdef0edb371f88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,226,109,100,243,101,234,98,91,135,104,187,43,253,239,14,219,55,31,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
