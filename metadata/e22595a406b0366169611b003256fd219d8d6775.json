The skipper tells his men they have top priority passes if they can make their way to Del Monte airfield 200 miles away, and advises them to split up into pairs. Ensign Chuck Palmer and crewman Jim Mitchell finally reach Tacloban on the island of Leyte. In an American mission school, Palmer meets Jeanne Martinez, who is urgently trying to see the officer in charge with a request for help for a relative, and he also learns that the Japanese have captured the airfield. Palmer tries to make Australia by a boat that sinks in a tropical storm and has to swim for shore. All through 1942, Palmer and the other survivors dodge enemy patrols while living off of the land. \n1950\n\n\nPLEASE SEED SO OTHERS CAN ENJOY\n\nTHANKS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e22595a406b0366169611b003256fd219d8d6775","amp;dn":"American+Guerrilla+in+the+Phillipines+VHS+Rip+xdiv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e22595a406b0366169611b003256fd219d8d6775","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,37,149,164,6,176,54,97,105,97,27,0,50,86,253,33,157,141,103,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
