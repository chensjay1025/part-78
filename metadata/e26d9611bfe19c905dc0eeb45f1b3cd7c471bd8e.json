Bury wrote his ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHistory of GreeceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ before World War I, but it was such a good overview of classical Greek history that the third edition was still being used as a college textbook in the late 1960ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s. In the newer editions, a co-author rewrote the material dealing with the early centuries where there have been new archeological developments, but the later chapters and BuryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s framework were retained essentially unchanged. Bury writes in a lucid, easily understood style that entertains as it educates. The book covers artistic and literary development, as well as politics and war, and its field of view includes western Asia Minor, the Agean archipelago, and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGreater GreeceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (Sicily and Southern Italy).
