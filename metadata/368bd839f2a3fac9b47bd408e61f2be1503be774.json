Atfer picking up her friends, McBride takes them to a bar so that the women can enjoy themselves, while she performs the song on stage.\n\nThe 9513 reviewer Blake Boldt gave the song a thumbs-up, stating that while the song &quot;stumbles in telling its story,&quot; it &quot;offers the listener a blast of sass thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sorely missing from country radio.&quot; He also favorably described the song's production as having a &quot;bluesier edge,&quot; with a &quot;groovy energy [that] breathes life into a slight little ditty.&quot;\n\n&quot;Wrong Baby Wrong Baby Wrong&quot; debuted at #51 on the U.S. Billboard  Hot Country Songs chart for the week of February 6, 2010.
