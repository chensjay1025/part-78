All you need is a web server ie: Apache, MYSQL, PHP and a text editor to edit the include files and database names.\n\nIt comes with a MYSQL query which is the backbone of the site, even the fucking login and register section is coded.\n\n\n            ALL THE USUAL FILES INCLUDED NOT MUCH PRIOR KNOWLEDGE NEEDED\n\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25f46ac132cd0aa5a6ff49fd8d9faa5ab958d49a","amp;dn":"An+advanced+clone+of+Mininova","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25f46ac132cd0aa5a6ff49fd8d9faa5ab958d49a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,244,106,193,50,205,10,165,166,255,73,253,141,159,170,90,185,88,212,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
