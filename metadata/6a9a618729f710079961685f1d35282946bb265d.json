Forgot Dead Can Dance and welcome AMÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­GANESHAÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­N.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Well, Fields of the Nephilim this ainÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t. On the other hand, their suggestion that you ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œforget Dead Can DanceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is right on the money. Every Worldbeat-influenced band with female vocalists is inevitably compared to DCD. (By that token, every band with a skillful keyboard player and pretentious baritone singer should be compared to Emerson, Lake and PalmerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ ) AmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢GaneshaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢n are a superb band in their own right, with a unique sound that is at once accessible and challenging. Smart listeners will check their preconceptions at the door, and prepare to be amazed. The vocals on this CD are astonishing. The birdlike trills on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDogmaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHymoniaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ are reminiscent of Yma Sumac or Minnie Ripperton; high, but never piercing or grating. On the low end, the sonorous chants of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAshesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ DanceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and the odd baritone scales of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRoad to IshnarÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ are hypnotic and unsettling. Things get especially interesting when the two combine: the vocal interplay in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œArthesiaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ evokes a choir dancing around a sacrificial altar, while the eerie throat-singing on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTibetan DreamÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ creates a menacing atmosphere, like tanks gathering at the border. Equally interesting is the instrumentation used. Gerhard, the multi-talented wizard behind RajnaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sound, continues to astound with his mastery. The portentous bass drum on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIllyriaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ could have come straight out of Moria, while the chimes and flutes of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFiery PilgrimageÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and bowed strings of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMajakongÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œKhatagÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ are goaded on by tablas and other less identifiable percussion. I found GerhardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s work with Rajna to be slick but a bit too conventional. Here heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s stretching himself and challenging the audience. The odd harmonies and dissonances spice things up and keep the CD from falling into the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWorld MuzakÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ trap. AmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢GaneshaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢n appears to be a side project for the musicians involved. I definitely want to hear more from their main bands: I would also encourage them to get back in the studio again with this group. Side projects are frequently self-indulgent egofests, of interest only to the most rabid or obsessive-compulsive collector. Occasionally, though, you strike gold. Freed of worries about commercial viability or genre, the artists are able to make the music they love. That appears to be what happened here. This isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcommercialÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ release ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ but itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s definitely got the potential for commercial success. If you like ambient/chill music, or if youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re a fan of Worldbeat, this CD is indispensible.
