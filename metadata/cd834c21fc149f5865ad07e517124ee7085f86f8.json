Convinced the world thinks he is crazy, the truth is much more nefarious. His doctor, Dr. Reinhard, somehow in possession of Professor Raymond Knowby's diary and the Necronomicon Ex-Mortis, plans on using the books to bring about his ascension to power. In the process he releases an army of Deadites on the unsuspecting world and it is Ash's job to stop the doctor and put the Deadites back where they belong.\n\nThe game begins in Sunny Meadows, an asylum Ash is committed to. Ash is briefly visited by his lawyer, Sally. Sally talks about how she found Professor Knowby's diary and believes Ash's story about the Necronomicon and the cabin. Ash thanks her, but just as she is about to leave Ash comments on her wardrobe and advises her to wear more revealing clothing. Just as Sally leaves, Reinhard accidentally unleashes the dead through the Necronomicon. The evil also breaks Ash free in the process. Ash travels through the asylum killing deadites with a pistol he retrieved from a dead security guard. He eventually finds his clothing, his boomstick and his chainsaw in the process. As he goes through the asylum, Ash finds an electric deadite named Sparky. Ash kills Sparky and decapitates him. Ash briefly breaks the fourth wall as he speaks to the camera and throws Sparky's head away. Ash proceeds through the nearby cellar. However, just as he is about to leave the asylum, Professor Knowby appears to Ash and tells him about Reinhard and what he plans to do. Ash, however, refuses to try and stop him and begins to leave. Professor Knowby also speaks about how Sally is in danger for taking his diary. Ash decides to stop Reinhard just to save Sally.\n\n\n\nSystem Requirements:\n====================\n\n* CD-ROM: 4X\n* CPU Speed: 800Mhz\n* CPU Type: Intel Pentium III\n* Disk Space: 2.0GB\n* Display: GeForce2 ATI 7500 +, DirectX 9 compatible Sound Card\n* Memory (RAM): 256MB\n* Operating System Compatibility: Win98/ME/2000/XP/Vista/7\n\n\nQUICK NOTE : not to much ram required but for who like to play this type of game is ok .\n\n                            \n\n                             \n                              ***** enjoy ... *****\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd834c21fc149f5865ad07e517124ee7085f86f8","amp;dn":"PC+%C3%82%C2%BB+EVIL+DEAD+REGENERATION+Full+Game+directplay+by+globe%40","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd834c21fc149f5865ad07e517124ee7085f86f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,131,76,33,252,20,159,88,101,173,7,229,23,18,78,231,8,95,134,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
