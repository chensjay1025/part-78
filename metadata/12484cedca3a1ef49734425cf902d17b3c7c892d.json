If you appreciate Thom Yorke, Radiohead, or the Muse, this is definitely for you! Very intelligent music. Beautifully rendered and recorded. Great piano sub-rhythms. Roman is an artist we can expect a lot of interesting pieces from. As of today, 24 March 2010, he is touring in Germany and will soon record his second main album, this time in Sweden.\n\nI hope he won't mind the upload. I've tried to buy this album on the internet, and to my surprise have not been able to do that. Our brilliant friends in the recording industry must have decided that Roman's music shall only be purchased in Germany. And then they wonder why folks resort to use the PirateBay.\n\n\n\nArtist: Roland Fischer\n\nTitle of album: Personare\n\n01 I don_t know who you are.mp3\n02 When he takes you down.mp3\n03 I can use u.mp3\n04 We see.mp3\n05 I will never die for you.mp3\n06 The proper order.mp3\n07 Silver.mp3\n08 Evil keys.mp3\n09 Waste.mp3\n10 All i know.mp3\n11 Persona.mp3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:12484cedca3a1ef49734425cf902d17b3c7c892d","amp;dn":"Roman+Fischer+-+Personare+%5B2006%5D+PB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"12484cedca3a1ef49734425cf902d17b3c7c892d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,72,76,237,202,58,30,244,151,52,66,92,249,2,209,123,60,124,137,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
