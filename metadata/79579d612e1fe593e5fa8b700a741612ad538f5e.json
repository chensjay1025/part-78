Sim stars as Captain Paris, an exasperated army chaplain and entertainments officer of a conscripted battalion. Attempting to put on a show for his troops, his idea for fun and games is a Brains Trust. Amazingly the punters flood in but his effort falls apart when he enlists the help of others and brows become furrowed over the interlocking private lives of three panellists.\nPitch perfect in the central role, Sim had a personal interest in the production and was pivotal in driving it to the screen after producing Birdie's play at Westminster Theatre in 1944.\n\nFeature Running Time: 89 min s approx Feature Aspect Ratio: 1.33:1\nFRANK LAUNDER AND SIDNEY GILLIAT PRESENT ALASTAIR SIM.\nROLAND CULVER ELIZABETH ALLAN MARTITA HUNT COLIN GORDON\nJANET BROWN IN &quot;FOLLY TO BE WISE&quot; ALSO STARRING MILES MALLESON\nEDWARD CHAPMAN PETER MARTYN\nDIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY JACK HILDYARD ART DIRECTOR ARTHUR LAWSON\nEDITOR THELMA CONNELL SCREENPLAY BY FRANK LAUNDER AND JOHN DIGHTON\nFROM A PLAY BY JAMES BRIDIE MUSIC BY TEMPLE ABADY\nPRODUCED BY SIDNEY GILLIAT AND FRANK LAUNDER DIRECTED BY FRANK LAUNDER\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â©1952 CANAL + IMAGE UK LTD\n\n\nPLEASE SEED THIS DONT JUST GRAB AND RUN THANK YOU","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79579d612e1fe593e5fa8b700a741612ad538f5e","amp;dn":"Folly+to+be+Wise+%281952+Alastair+Sim%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79579d612e1fe593e5fa8b700a741612ad538f5e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,87,157,97,46,31,229,147,229,250,139,112,10,116,22,18,173,83,143,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
