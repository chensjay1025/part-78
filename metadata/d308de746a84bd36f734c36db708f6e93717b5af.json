It plows through the atmosphere in a second or two. Whether it's a deep ocean or not doesn't matter; it's so much bigger than the depth of the deepest ocean that it just blasts out a huge crater. This is going to obliterate all the life on a continental scale. Anything that's unprotected is going to die within the first minutes after impact.&quot;\n- Prof. Jay Melosh\n\nStars: Dennis Cubic, Megan Gay, Pascal Langdale, Helena Lindemann, Nina Liu, James Matthews-Pyecka, Errol Shaker, The Baka Pygmies\nDirector: Stefan Schneider\n\nMPAA Rating: Not Rated for (may be intense for younger viewers)\nRun Time: 01h:23m:55s\nRelease Date: December 04, 2007\nUPC: 014381448320\nGenre: documentary\n\n\nReview By: Rich Rosell   \nPublished: December 06, 2007\n\nOne of the conceptual problems with most science shows dealing with yet-to-happen future events is that there's no footage to show, no definites to comment on. It's all big if's. The format is typically smart guy talking head speculation, periodically augmented by some computer animations to reinforce what's being talked about. Not that that's badÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½because scary science stories about what cataclysmic tragedy might be lying in wait for Earth are always welcome in my home. I like to know what might be lurking, whether it's in my future or not.\n\nSuper Comet: After The Impact from Image is a Science Channel/Discovery Channel special that addresses the big &quot;what if's&quot; of a massive outerspace rock smashing into our planet, much like what may have happened to wipe out the dinosaurs. But instead of simply having experts sit around and analyze or dissect what they think might take place after the world as we know it ends, this clever special borrows from the summer action movie blockbuster formula. A small cast of characters in different parts of the world (Hawaii, Paris, Mexico, Cameroon) are each involved in their own individual dramas based on the days leading up to and the months after the big impact, and in between the real experts do a war room round table to tell us what's likely to happen next.\n\nIt's a neat way to dress up all the speculating, and combined with a big, dramatic score the whole package carries it off pretty well. Like a mini-movie. Even the visual effects fall within acceptable ranges, especially considering I have seen far worse on Sci-Fi Channel original movies. There's even an Armageddon-style nuclear deflection attempt that fails miserably in the opening minutes as a nervous family in Paris watches on television, setting up the inevitable, which based on the title shouldn't be that much of a surprise.\n\nThere isn't really a whole lot of good news here, considering a lot of us would likely fall into the &quot;dead upon impact&quot; category. But it's a fairly exciting presentation, nonetheless, even if some of the acting is a little overdone at times. Director Stefan Schneider keeps a quick pace to things, bouncing around what's left of the planet as things get worse and worse. The chatter about survival and the human spirit is hopeful, I guess, yet it's the wholesale destruction that's the meat-and-potatoes here, and the experts don't soften the potential ugliness at all.\n\nWatch the skies.\n\n\nSEED PLEASE \n=============------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCheers,\n\nDarkman","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d308de746a84bd36f734c36db708f6e93717b5af","amp;dn":"Super+Comet+-+After+The+Impact+%5Bws.dsr.xvid-k4rm4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d308de746a84bd36f734c36db708f6e93717b5af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,8,222,116,106,132,189,54,247,52,195,109,183,8,246,233,55,23,181,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
