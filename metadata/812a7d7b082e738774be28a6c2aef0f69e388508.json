A sound which is brutally aggressive joins with well-written metal-influenced-hardcore to show its unabashed rebellion against the genreÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s restricting conventions. As experimental metal begins to flow with the mainstream, Wrench In The Works desists from the gimmicks that plague the stage during so many metal-hardcore hybrid shows, allowing the unconventionality of their writing to shine through.\n\nWrench In The WorksÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ accomplishments have exceeded the status quo of the average underground band.  The band released their Facedown debut ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLost Art of Heaping CoalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in 2008.  Now, with seemingly limitless ingenuity and passion, members Andy Nelson, Greg Thomas and Darrell Tauro will continue shattering eardrums as well as genre barriers as they write and record for their sophomore Facedown release ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDecrease/IncreaseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ due out February 2010.&quot;\n\n\n\nOne of my personal favorites on Facedown Records.They have a new CD out called Decrease/Increase,but I don't have it yet.I might upload that too whenever I get a copy if anyone is interested.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:812a7d7b082e738774be28a6c2aef0f69e388508","amp;dn":"Wrench+in+the+Works+-+Lost+Art+of+Heaping+Coal","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"812a7d7b082e738774be28a6c2aef0f69e388508","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,42,125,123,8,46,115,135,116,190,40,166,194,174,240,246,158,56,133,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
