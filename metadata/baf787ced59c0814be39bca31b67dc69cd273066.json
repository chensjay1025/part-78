After a legal battle, Crystal Dynamics continued the series without Silicon Knights and Eidos Interactive became the publisher. Each game in the series incorporates elements of action and puzzle-solving in its gameplay and all are set in the fictional setting of Nosgoth, united by the character of Kain, the series' amoral vampire antihero.\n\nTo date five games comprise the Legacy of Kain series, each one developed for video game consoles and later ported to Microsoft Windows. The series has enjoyed critical success, and has been widely praised for high-quality voice acting, storytelling, and visuals.\n\n\n\n\n* watch the intro video of the latest legacy of kain : defiance in this link :\n\nhttp://\nwww.swfcabin.com\n/open/1273613029\n\n\nGames\n\nTitle Year Platform Notes\n \nBlood Omen: Legacy of Kain NA 1996\nPAL 1997\nPlayStation\n\nWindows A 2D action-adventure game in the same vein as Diablo. The game's selling points included its 50+ hour length and the wide array of items and abilities the player character commands. Blood Omen introduces Nosgoth, a fictional world designed with fantasy novel-like complexity, and gives the player control of Kain, a newly resurrected vampire seeking revenge against his murderers and a cure for his vampiric curse.\n \nLegacy of Kain: Soul Reaver NA 1999\nPAL 1999\nPlayStation\nWindows\nDreamcast\n\nBased on a Crystal Dynamics game concept dubbed Shifter, which was integrated into the Legacy of Kain universe at an early point in development. The game's staff likened the technological advance from Blood Omen to Soul Reaver to the evolution of The Legend of Zelda series from the Super Nintendo to the Nintendo 64 - bringing the franchise into 3D while maintaining a similar style. The game introduces a new protagonist, Raziel, one of Kain's six 'sons' and lieutenants.\n \nLegacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 2 NA 2001\nPAL 2001\nPlayStation 2\nWindows \n\nA direct sequel to Soul Reaver which picks up the story where the previous game left off. The developers' overall goal was to retain the elements that made the prequel successful, but they decided to eschew the 'complete a level, fight a boss' game flow of the prequel in favor of a more story-driven approach. Raziel is still in pursuit of Kain, but now he must uncover the mysteries surrounding his own destiny.\n \nBlood Omen 2: Legacy of Kain NA 2002\nPAL 2002\nPlayStation 2\nXbox\nWindows\nNintendo GameCube \n\nDeveloped by a different team at Crystal Dynamics, this sequel to Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain has many of the qualities that make the series popular, but shifts the focus more on gore and combat, while the puzzles were criticized as simplistic.[26] The setting, an enormous industrial city, is a departure for the series. In this game, players again control Kain in his campaign to conquer Nosgoth. The events of Blood Omen 2 did not occur in the original history, and only took place in Nosgoth's timeline due to a paradoxical event which took place in the final act of Soul Reaver 2. \n\nLegacy of Kain: Defiance NA 2003\nPAL 2004\nPlayStation 2\nXbox\n\nWindows The fifth Legacy of Kain game represents an effort to consolidate and re-balance the storytelling, puzzle-solving and combat aspects of the series, taking cues from Devil May Cry in gameplay. The player takes control of both Kain and Raziel to discover how their destinies are intertwined, concluding on a hopeful note, but without full resolution.\n\n\n[this fantastic text was extracted from wikipedia]\n\n\n* CURIOSITYS ABOUT THIS COLLECTION :\n\nSome areas of the games was deleted after the work by the programmers , the motives for that only them know why , more information for curiositys like this one and extra nice stuff about this series of games can be watched in the next link \n(this site was totally concebed thinking in this fantastic series of games , take a look...) :\n\nhttp://\nwww.thelost\nworlds.net/\n\n\n\n\n* UPLOADER NOTE :\n\n\nIn a moment without too many nice new games to work , i think that a very nice collection come in handy and this series of games for the carismatic gameplay with fascinating puzzles and intriguing movies and moves , was time to deserve a complete file with the games of the series , i started with a main file with 3 games but then i realise that this file deserved better and i started the search for the correct work to the restant 2 games to complete the all collection , so in total , with the 2 complete games in nice links and the 3 games in the main file , we have all thew complete collection of the Legacy Of Kain for 2 giga and a little bit mega ...\n\nI hope all the users of the file appreciate in there own time all the fascination of this games , the games are complete with very nice work and easy to use in directplay mode , if the possible users of this file already played any of this games , i think the file still downloadable because for 1.32 gb all this 3 games , not too much for shore and the upgrade files in nice links certainly not too much time to get a new complete nice game ready to go in not too much time and if you just not played one of them , that already justify the download because any of this games are enjoyable and finally having all this 5 games in the same place in a pratical way certainly reconfortating to the user ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                       \n                                  ***** enjoy ... *****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:baf787ced59c0814be39bca31b67dc69cd273066","amp;dn":"PC+%C3%82%C2%BB+LEGACY+OF+KAIN+COLLECTION+directplay+by+globe%40","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"baf787ced59c0814be39bca31b67dc69cd273066","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,247,135,206,213,156,8,20,190,57,188,163,27,103,220,105,205,39,48,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
