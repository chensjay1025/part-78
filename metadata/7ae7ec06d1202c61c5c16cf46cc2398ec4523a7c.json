The song is both an example and a parody of the dance song genre  in which much of the content of the song is given over to dance step instructions. The dance is one of the major audience-participation activities during screenings of the film and performances of the show. It has become a popular song beyond the reaches of the film and show, and is often played at dances and weddings. Cover versions have been recorded by such artists as Alvin and the Chipmunks, Black Lace, Damian, Groovie Ghoulies, Jive Bunny and the Mastermixers, and Sebastian Bach of the heavy metal band Skid Row, as well as an Italian adaptation by Elio e le Storie Tese and a Spanish adaptation by the pop group Timbiriche.\n\nThe song, fourth in the film (after &quot;Science Fiction/Double Feature&quot;, &quot;Dammit, Janet!&quot;, and &quot;Over at the Frankenstein Place&quot;), but fifth in the original stage show and 2006-2007 UK tour (Sweet Transvestite precedes it), consists of verses sung by alternating characters, serving as the introduction to two of them, and choruses sung by the chorus of &quot;Transylvanians&quot; (Movie) or &quot;Phantoms&quot; (Musical), and the Criminologist/Narrator (played by Charles Gray in the movie). The characters that sing the verses are, in order, Riff-Raff (Richard O'Brien in the movie), Magenta (Patricia Quinn in the movie), and Columbia (Little Nell Campbell in the movie). After the second full chorus, Columbia often launches into her tap dance, however recent versions have replaced it with such diverse substitutes as a Dance Dance Revolution pattern, an air guitar solo, and a rally-like chant.\n\nThe order of the solos varies in certain albums. In the movie and Roxy cast album, Columbia's solo is right after Magenta's, then Columbia does her tap dance after a second chorus. The version that has been in stage shows more recently is similar to the movie and Roxy cast, with Columbia singing her solo right after Magenta's, but then she does her tap dance right after her solo, leaving only two choruses. Occasionally, Columbia's solo and tap dance come after the chorus after Magenta's solo.\n\nThe song is reprised/revisited briefly at the end of the film, in flashback, and in the show as an encore, led by Dr Frank N. Furter.\n\nOn The Drew Carey Show, Drew and his friends compete in a dance off with Mimi and her friends. Drew dances to Time Warp while Mimi dances to Shake Your Groove Thing by Peaches and Herb. In October 2006, the song was ranked and voted 338 out of 2006 songs featured in the Triple M Essential 2006 Countdown.\n\nThe Rocky Horror Show is a long-running British stage musical, opening in London on 19 June 1973. It was written by Richard O'Brien, and developed by O'Brien in collaboration with Australian theater director Jim Sharman. It came eighth in a BBC Radio 2 listener poll of the &quot;Nation's Number One Essential Musicals&quot;.\n\nThe play was adapted as the 1975 film The Rocky Horror Picture Show.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ae7ec06d1202c61c5c16cf46cc2398ec4523a7c","amp;dn":"Rocky+Horror+Picture+Show+-+Time+Warp++%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ae7ec06d1202c61c5c16cf46cc2398ec4523a7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,231,236,6,209,32,44,97,197,193,108,244,108,194,57,142,196,82,58,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
