The forest greets Emma with startling force. At first she canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t move her limbs. Then her vision is rendered useless. The sensation comes more often, and the symptoms become frightening as Emma is left paralyzed to the force that emerges from the forest. Voices come in dream at first, commanding against her will. Something is out there that calls Emma to the forest. It isn't going to fade until she surrenders.\n\n-------\n\nIf you enjoy it, please support the official release!\n\nTE4MPL0Y","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:655ec66aa23d4de34351f74e2d84b8abfea00503","amp;dn":"Mandi+Lynn+-+Essence","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"655ec66aa23d4de34351f74e2d84b8abfea00503","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,94,198,106,162,61,77,227,67,81,247,78,45,132,184,171,254,160,5,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
