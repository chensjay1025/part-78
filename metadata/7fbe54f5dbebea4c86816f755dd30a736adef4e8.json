After releasing 2 self promoted albums, and non-stop touring, the band signed with Victory Records in 1998. 1999 saw the release of their Victory debut ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFlesh And BloodÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and a US tour with New York hardcore Godfathers ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Agnostic Front. During that tour, Agnostic Front invited NIV to do a 5 week ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œUnity FestÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ European tour with them and the US Bombs. This tour consisted of 33 shows in 35 days in a dozen different countries with an average attendance of 1,000 people each night. In 2000 longtime guitarist Corey Edelmann decided to leave the band and he was replaced by Tim Mason who had played in the NIV side project band ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ DodginÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Bullets. The band took some time off to work on writing new material and then a summer tour was done with Hatebreed and One King Down. In 2001, the band recorded their second album for Victory (and fourth total) titled ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTipping The ScalesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. Lyrically this album was the most intense as it addressed the loss of Jason MoodyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s son Dominic. The closing track ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œReunionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and some of the records artwork were done in dedication to him. In the summer of 2001 NIV did their final tour with long time friends xDisciplex AD and The Deal. All of the members decided to wind the band down in 2002 and there were only a few shows played including Cornerstone Festival, Furnace Fest and 2 final shows in Southern California. The final US show was Aug. 30, 2002 at the Showcase Theatre with Hatebreed, Terror, and Powerhouse. In late September the band flew to Puerto Rico to play 3 shows there. Those were the final No Innocent Victim shows. UntilÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦.\n\nAt 2004ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Cornerstone Festival, the band made a surprise appearance and performed 3 songs on Seventh StarÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s set. Jason Moody announced at that time that the band was getting back together to work on a new album. Dissapointment with the lack of integrity in todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hardcore scene fueled the re-union of this band to do what they did best for the initial 10 years that they were a band ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ tell people the truth without fear of being rejected, mocked or ridiculed. Long time guitarist ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Corey Edlemann has rejoined the band on guitar with Tim Mason which will see NIV as a 5 piece for the first time in their career. Former xDisciplex AD member ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Neil Hartman was added to bass and the line up was finalized.\n\nThe band signed a deal with Facedown Records on Oct. 22, 2004 for the release of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTo Burn AgainÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ which came out in Nov of 2005. Lyrically they tackled the issue that inspired the reunion ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a lack of Integrity in the people that claim to be Christians. Drummer Jason Dunn states it like this: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIf the world is to see the truth of the teachings of Jesus Christ, it will be because of His followers living those teachings out in their lives. If you claim to be something ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ live it. Challenge yourself to not be the hypocrite that people will base their rejection of Christianity onÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.&quot;\n\n\n\nI'm missing a few demos and splits,but other than that,this includes every major release.\n\nTo Burn Again-2005\nTipping the Scales-2001\nFlesh &amp; Blood-1999\nThe Crazy Engler Brothers-1999\nNo Compromise-1997\nStrength-1995\n\n\nThis is the band that got me into hardcore,and they're still one of my favorite bands.Please,if you download this,go support the band any way you can,they deserve it!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7fbe54f5dbebea4c86816f755dd30a736adef4e8","amp;dn":"No+Innocent+Victim+%28Almost+Complete%29+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7fbe54f5dbebea4c86816f755dd30a736adef4e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,190,84,245,219,235,234,76,134,129,111,117,93,211,10,115,106,222,244,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
