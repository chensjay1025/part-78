Of course that last one is often the trickiest of all. Beth falls hard for Tommy (Porter), a sexy, young Wall Street hot-shot. But just as everything seems to be falling into place, complications arise in the form of Tommy's sensitive and handsome co-worker Daniel (Greenberg). Beth soon learns that the game of love in the big city is a lot like Wall Street -- high risk, high reward and everybody has an angle.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:758d9e6674a5ee934620caaad474cd6fb8a66453","amp;dn":"The.Good.Guy.2009.LIMITED.DVDRip.XviD-AMIABLE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"758d9e6674a5ee934620caaad474cd6fb8a66453","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,141,158,102,116,165,238,147,70,32,202,170,212,116,205,111,184,166,100,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
