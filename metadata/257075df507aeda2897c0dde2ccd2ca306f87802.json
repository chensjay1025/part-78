I have a personal friend who worked on this project, and the movies are hard to find on the internet and rarely get rerun, so I want to make sure people can see these engaging documentaries.\n\n\n\nFrom ESPN's 30 for 30 official site for Small Potatoes: Who Killed The USFL?:\n\nIn 1983 the upstart United States Football League (USFL) had the audacity to challenge the almighty NFL. The new league did the unthinkable by playing in the spring and plucked three straight Heisman Trophy winners away from the NFL. The 12-team USFL played before crowds that averaged 25,000, and started off with respectable TV ratings. But with success came expansion and new owners, including a certain high profile and impatient real estate baron whose vision was at odds with the leagueÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s founders. Soon, the USFL was reduced to waging a desperate anti-trust lawsuit against the NFL, which yielded an ironic verdict that effectively forced the league out of business. Now, almost a quarter of a century later, Academy Award-nominated and Peabody Award-winning director Mike Tollin, himself once a chronicler of the league, will showcase the remarkable influence of those three years on football history and attempt to answer the question, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWho Killed the USFL?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n\nAbout 30 for 30:\n\n[30 for 30] is an unprecedented documentary series featuring thirty films from some of todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s finest storytellers. Each filmmaker will bring their passion and personal point of view to their film detailing the issues, trends, athletes, teams, rivalries, games and events that transformed the sports landscape from 1979 to 2009.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:257075df507aeda2897c0dde2ccd2ca306f87802","amp;dn":"ESPN+-+30+for+30%3A+Small+Potatoes%3A+Who+Killed+The+USFL%3F+%28HD+720p%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"257075df507aeda2897c0dde2ccd2ca306f87802","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,112,117,223,80,122,237,162,137,124,13,222,44,205,44,163,6,248,120,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
