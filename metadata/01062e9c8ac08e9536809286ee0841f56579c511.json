I wasn't resizing first since it cuts the uncompressed data by just over 100GB. Which to me, didn't sound good, but I think it actually does look better.\n\nSo feel free to let me know how you think it compares to my previous rips.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01062e9c8ac08e9536809286ee0841f56579c511","amp;dn":"Lost+S06E14+HQ+HDTV+AC3+DivX+%28Re-Encode+From+720p%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01062e9c8ac08e9536809286ee0841f56579c511","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,6,46,156,138,192,142,149,54,128,146,134,238,8,65,245,101,121,197,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
