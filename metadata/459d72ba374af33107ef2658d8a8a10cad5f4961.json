A good starting point for anyone coming to this multi-talented artist. ~ Cub Koda, AMG\n\nThe first time I heard Gatemouth was in 1952 as a 7th grader.  His 78 rpm record, &quot;The Okie Dokie Stomp&quot; was on the cafeteria jukebox, and it played over and over and over again during the lunch hour.  Then a few years later I was lucky enough to get my own DJ show on one of the local Galveston radio stations.  I chose &quot;The Okie Dokie Stomp&quot; for my theme song and it stayed with me for as long as I was known a Brokenhearted Bill.  Gatemouth must be in his late 70s by now, but his style with a guitar has never been successfully copied.  Many have tried. If you like the blues, Gatemouth needs to be included in your collection, and this CD is a good place to start. ~ William S.
