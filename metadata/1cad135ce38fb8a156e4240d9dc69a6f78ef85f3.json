Once installed SuperRam begins \nto monitor the total amount of memory your computer has installed, it also monitors \nwhen your computer reaches a threshold of memory to maintain, \nwhen that threshold is reached SuperRam immediately will release \nall memory that it determines can be released on the computer system back to Windows.\nWhen SuperRam is installed any new application, program or game that is opened will use \nphysical memory installed on the computer and placing applications that you opened \npreviously to use virtual memory. This allows software to run with an emphasis on \nperformance when performance is needed; such as when playing games, \nediting photos/videos, using processor and memory intensive applications \n \n* Features and Benefits of SuperRam\n\nOptimizes computer memory by freeing wasted memory back to the computer, \ngiving applications access to physical memory.\nRuns as a Windows Service application, which allows the software to run even when \nyou are not logged into the computer.\nHandles up to 2 TB of RAM on Windows 2008 and up to 128 GB of RAM on Windows 7 and Windows Vista. \nWindows XP, 2000 and 2003 still support up to 4 GB of RAM.\nMemory benchmark test feature has been added in to get an estimate of how \nfast and stable your computer memory is.\nAdvanced settings added to prevent excessive memory defragmentation, \nmonitoring processor usage and battery status.\nNew and improved modern user interface, easy and intuitive to use and compliant \nwith Windows user interface guidelines.\nSoftware supports multiple languages and translations of all visible text to allow \nusers all over the world to use SuperRam in their native language.\nSoftware updates can be downloaded and installed directly from inside the \napplication without having to visit our web site.\nSoftware was developed with full Windows themes, colors and up to 192 DPI support.\n---------------\nInstall Notes:\n---------------\nDisconnect internet connection !!\nWhen you have firewall, block all outgoing superram connection!\n\n1) run superram.exe\nAfter installing program don't run it. \nDouble click SuperRam.reg and click yes\n* See unpack directory/serial-regkey for reg.key Superram.reg\nDone\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1cad135ce38fb8a156e4240d9dc69a6f78ef85f3","amp;dn":"SuperRam+6.5.10.2010+%2B+serial+-TrT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1cad135ce38fb8a156e4240d9dc69a6f78ef85f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,173,19,92,227,143,184,161,86,228,36,13,157,198,154,111,120,239,133,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
