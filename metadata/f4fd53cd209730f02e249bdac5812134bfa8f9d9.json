Then they decided to try something really out there. They subdivided an area outside of town and sold the lots for $1 each. There was a catch. You have to build and live there, off the grid. Only green, sustainable housing is allowed, and no power. The first fourteen lots disappeared fast. People showed up to build.\n\nEco-Home Adventures follows the lives of these re-pioneers for over a year as they strive to build something unique, a model community to show that a sustainable village off the grid is possible. The obstacles were many. Weather, a steep learning curve, and the clash of a new community trying to fit into a small town knit together over a hundred years of farming. They rolled the dice, and the results are not what anyone expected.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4fd53cd209730f02e249bdac5812134bfa8f9d9","amp;dn":"Eco-Home+Adventures+-+CBC+2010-03-24.mpg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4fd53cd209730f02e249bdac5812134bfa8f9d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,253,83,205,32,151,48,240,46,36,155,218,197,129,33,52,191,168,249,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
