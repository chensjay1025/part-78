In order to play it, you must follow these steps:\n\n* get yourself a copy of the game (e.g. from here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/3514608/The_Last_Express_Win_Mac)\n* download this very torrent\n* unzip TLE.zip file\n* right click on the unzipped TLE.app package\n* show package contents\n* navigate to Contents/Resources/tle\n* copy CD1.HPF and DATA directory from the first CD, CD2.HPF from the second CD and CD3.HPF from the third CD to this (tle) directory\n* enjoy the game\n\nThe know issue is that colours in full screen mode are broken but if you're a walkthrough junkie, you'll play in windowed mode anyway;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c04d4932778fb7c90b158f92a40e9aed4c91061e","amp;dn":"The+Last+Express+wrapper","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c04d4932778fb7c90b158f92a40e9aed4c91061e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,77,73,50,119,143,183,201,11,21,143,146,164,14,154,237,76,145,6,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
