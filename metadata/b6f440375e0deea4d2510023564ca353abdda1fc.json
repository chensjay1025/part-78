Her widowed husband, bank employee Ricardo Morales, is shocked by the news; EspÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³sito vows to find the killer and bring him to justice. In his ordeal he is aided by his alcoholic assistent Pablo Sandoval and a newcomer, the upper class lawyer Irene MenÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ndez-Hastings, who takes over as department chief. EspÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³sito's rivaling partner Romano pins the murder on two immigrant workers so as to get rid of the matter - an issue that enrages EspÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³sito, who attacks Romano in a fury.\n\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6f440375e0deea4d2510023564ca353abdda1fc","amp;dn":"The+Secret+of+their+eyes%282%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6f440375e0deea4d2510023564ca353abdda1fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,244,64,55,94,13,238,164,210,81,0,35,86,76,163,83,171,221,161,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
