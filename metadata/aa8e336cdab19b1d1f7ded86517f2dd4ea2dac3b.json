Generally this includes such topics as the personality of the Spirit, the deity of the Spirit, and the work of the Spirit throughout Scripture.\nThe Personhood of the Holy Spirit\n\nThe personality (and therefore Ã¢â‚¬Å“personhoodÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) of the Holy Spirit has been denied by certain groups throughout the history of the church. Some point out that the noun for Ã¢â‚¬Å“spiritÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in the NT is pneuma which is neuter and, therefore, the spirit is correctly referred to as Ã¢â‚¬Å“itÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ rather than Ã¢â‚¬Å“he.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ In keeping with this idea, some refer to it [him] as Ã¢â‚¬Å“GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s active force,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ almost in a Gnostic sense of an emanation from the one, true God. Before we look at the Biblical evidence, it is important to point out that there is no necessary connection in Koine Greek between grammatical gender and personal gender so it is simply false to say that since the Greek noun pneuma is neuter the spirit must be an Ã¢â‚¬Å“it.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n\n\nBible Studies - Pneumatology\nDoctrine of the Holy Spirit\nPneumatology 1 - Pastor's Ministry Workshop - Austin Bible Church\nPneumatology 2 - Austin Bible Church\nSystematic Theology - Pneumatology\nWTBI   Pneumatology - Holy Hills Baptist Church\n\nThis is in memory of my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011. Now she knows.\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe The Above Statement and that the Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed...\n\n&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...hmmm sounds like some of us might be Immortal. (Ask your preacher about that)\n\nMore Torrents in this series at http://conspiracyhub.com/membershares.php?it=41 ALL TORRENTS are RELEASED here FIRST!!!
