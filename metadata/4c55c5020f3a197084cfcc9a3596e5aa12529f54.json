He has worked in a number of areas of theoretical physics and cosmology, focusing on developing fundamental theories and new observational tests. With Stephen Hawking, he developed the Hawking-Turok instanton solutions describing the birth of inflationary universes, and with Paul Steinhardt developed a cyclic theory of the universe.
