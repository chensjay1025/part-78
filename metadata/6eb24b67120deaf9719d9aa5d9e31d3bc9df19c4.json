The soldiers make their way to town in order to find it. But what they find in \n&quot;the armpit of nowhere&quot; is unexpected and horrible. Dead bodies are lying about \neverywhere. Suddenly an old man runs up to their Humvee screaming for help. But it's \ntoo late - for the soldiers. Within moments they are stricken by something unknown. \nAnd then they're dead. Soon, Dr. Jeremy Stone will lead a crack team of scientists as \nthey work feverishly in a secret, state-of-the-art laboratory to discover what has \nkilled the citizens of Piedmont, and why two survivors seem to have been immune. \nThey have little time. Whatever wiped out the people of the small town is spreading \nacross the country and killing everyone in its path. Meanwhile, a rogue television \nreporter battles with sinister government agents to learn the truth about the disaster.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6eb24b67120deaf9719d9aa5d9e31d3bc9df19c4","amp;dn":"The+Andromeda+Strain+PAL+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6eb24b67120deaf9719d9aa5d9e31d3bc9df19c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,178,75,103,18,13,234,249,113,157,154,165,217,227,29,59,201,223,25,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
