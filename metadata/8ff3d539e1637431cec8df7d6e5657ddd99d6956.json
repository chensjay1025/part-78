Now the U.S. Army is stockpiling millions of America's favorite calibers not even used by NATO in a process that will no doubt raise the price of ammo to unprecedented heights. \n\nPolitical suppression is no longer constrained to drab IRS offices as college students wearing &quot;Tea Party&quot; t-shirts are denied entry to hear Obama speak on their campus. \n\nDr. Paul Craig Roberts, former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury under the Reagan Administration and a prolific writer, joins the show to talk to Alex about how the ultra-elite has completely hi-jacked our republic and continue to cut free the rest of the constitutional restraints which hold back unlimited control.\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential \n to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a\n spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the &quot;big \n picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media \n for news and info is a prescription for ignorance.
