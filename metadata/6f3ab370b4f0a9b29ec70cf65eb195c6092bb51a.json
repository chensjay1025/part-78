Unfortunately the show isn't complete, as the producers explain in the notes that's because the average show in August 1974 was too long for a tape. The tape of this particular show from the 24th (Midnight) ran out after 'If You Talk In Your Sleep' and therefore the producers decided to complete it with a part of the August 29 Dinner Show for the 'complete concert' experience. The show itself is pretty good. - See more at: http://www.elvis.com.a","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f3ab370b4f0a9b29ec70cf65eb195c6092bb51a","amp;dn":"Elvis+Presley+-+It%27s+Midnight+%28FTD%29+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f3ab370b4f0a9b29ec70cf65eb195c6092bb51a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,58,179,112,180,240,169,178,158,199,12,246,94,177,149,198,9,43,181,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
