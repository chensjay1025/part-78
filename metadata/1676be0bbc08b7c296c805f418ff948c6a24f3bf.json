Barely escaping he soon renounced violence to atone for his past sins, seeking out redemption in a life of peace. That is until the followers of priest turned sorcerer Malachi kidnap a Purtian girl Meredith Crowthorn and brutally slaughter her family before his very own eyes (including butchering her beloved younger brother Edward who Solomon had befriended)! Forcing Solomon to take up arms and return to his violent ways once more to rescue her! In doing so means returning to his birthplace and facing his older brother Marcus who (in his youth) he accidentally left disfigured (and for dead), who now serves as merciless enforcer to Malachi. \n\n\nAudio :  English DD 5.1 - 448 Kbps     \n\n      \nSubs :  English, Romanian, Portuguese-Brazil, Chinese x 2\n\n\nRegular DVDR converted from a BluRayRip , playable on a standalone dvd player\n\neng subs is retail.
