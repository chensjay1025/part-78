It is named after the Miracle Mile neighborhood of Los Angeles, where most of the action takes place.\n\nThe film takes place in a single day and night, beginning as the two main characters, Harry (Anthony Edwards) and Julie (Mare Winningham), meet and are immediately attracted to each other. They make a date for later in the evening, but fail to meet due to a quirk of fate. While they are apart, Harry receives a wrong-number phone call, and is told that, unbeknownst to everyone else, nuclear war is about to break out in fifty minutes. He searches frantically for Julie, helped and hindered by various strangers, who are initially unaware of the impending apocalypse.\n\n\nCAST:\n---------------------------\nAnthony Edwards as Harry Washello\nMare Winningham as Julie Peters\nJohn Agar as Ivan Peters\nLou Hancock as Lucy Peters\nMykelti Williamson as Wilson\nKelly Jo Minter as Charlotta\nKurt Fuller as Gerstead\nDenise Crosby as Landa\nRobert DoQui as Fred the Cook\nO-Lan Jones as Waitress\nClaude Earl Jones as Harlan\nAlan Rosenberg as Mike\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097889/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097889/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracle_Mile_(film)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracle_Mile_(film)&lt;/a&gt;\n___________________________________________________________\n\nTangerine Dream - Miracle Mile Soundtrack\n\nPlaylist length:11 tracks 41 minutes 31 seconds \n\nPlaylist files:\n\n01.Teetering Scales (3:40)\n02.One for the Books (3:07)\n03.After the Call (5:13)\n04.On the Spur of the Moment (3:03)\n05.All of a Dither (3:26)\n06.Final Statement (3:16)\n07.In Julie's Eyes (3:15)\n08.Running Out of Time (3:31)\n09.If it's all Over (4:36)\n10.People in the News (5:11)\n11.Museum Walk (3:13)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64d4a1cfbfa68378557d9a70dbb064aeb9f22e8a","amp;dn":"Miracle+Mile%5B1988%5D+Movie%2C+Trailer+%26+OST","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64d4a1cfbfa68378557d9a70dbb064aeb9f22e8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,212,161,207,191,166,131,120,85,125,154,112,219,176,100,174,185,242,46,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
