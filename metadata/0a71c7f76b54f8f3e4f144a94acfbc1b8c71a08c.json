Blond, blue-eyed twins.\nBizarre and inexplicable, could they be the product of\nMengele's machinations? Now, with exclusive access,\nEXPLORER goes inside the investigation; From the\nsecret agents who trailed him, to the scientists now\nuncovering the facts behind the fantastical phenomenon,\nno stone is left unturned. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://channel.nationalgeographic.com/series/explorer/4087/Overview&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://channel.nationalgeographic.com/series/explorer/4087/Overview&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a71c7f76b54f8f3e4f144a94acfbc1b8c71a08c","amp;dn":"Explorer.Nazi.Mystery.Twins.From.Brazil.HDTV.XviD-sHoTV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a71c7f76b54f8f3e4f144a94acfbc1b8c71a08c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,113,199,247,107,84,248,243,228,241,68,169,74,207,188,27,140,113,160,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
