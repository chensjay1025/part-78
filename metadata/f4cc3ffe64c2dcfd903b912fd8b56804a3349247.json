It's an encyclopaedia of everything a human \n       being can eat, from aardvark to zucchini, all catalogued in 2,650 \n       separate entries. But it is much more than just a food reference \n       book; it is a portrait of the whole human race, its many cultures, \n       customs and histories, all revealed through the stories of what we \n       eat. If you want to understand why the Genoese enjoy dolphin, how \n       to cook a warthog, why the French call dandelions 'piss-en-lit' or \n       who invented Spam, then 'The Companion', as it is known by \n       aficionados, is the place to look.\n       \n       Alan Davidson died in 2003, just four years after his magnum opus \n       was published. He had already achieved guru status among foodies \n       and professional chefs but, in fact, he became a writer almost by \n       accident. His first career had been as a British diplomat, serving \n       in various overseas offices. A visit by his wife to a Tunisian \n       fish market first piqued his interest in writing about seafood, \n       and a later posting to Laos convinced him to resign from the \n       Foreign Service and become a full-time writer.\n       \n       Through interviews with Davidson's colleagues, admirers, family \n       and friends, Graham-Dixon creates a portrait of a remarkable man \n       who not only compiled a unique record of humanity's eating habits, \n       but also helped turn the study of food into a serious academic \n       discipline by instigating an annual symposium at Oxford University \n       where visitors can learn about, amongst other things, the role of \n       vegetables in the conquest of space and how to make a musical \n       carrot.\n\n\n                             Big up all scene massive!\n\n\n    \n                                       \n                GROUP  INFORMATION          \n         9 Years of the Force and still    \n                      going strong                  \n     \n\n           What we are looking for:\n\n           * gigabit euro sites for x264 only\n           * Fios x264 rippers or cappers\n           * also we have a contest to annouce we are in need of a\n           * new nfo ascii artwork design email us with your designs\n           * winners artwork will be added as our new nfo\n           * dont forget to tag your work\n           * If you think you can help contact us on irc\n           * or email us at &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;b2f4ddc0d1d7f2dac7c1da9cd3db&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4cc3ffe64c2dcfd903b912fd8b56804a3349247","amp;dn":"The.Man.Who.Ate.Everything.2010.WS.PDTV.XviD-aAF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4cc3ffe64c2dcfd903b912fd8b56804a3349247","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,204,63,254,100,194,220,253,144,59,145,47,216,181,104,4,163,52,146,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
