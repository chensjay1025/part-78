Tried to noise down the audio a little bit but the quality of the whole show would be terrible, not worth it. So the bass will loud!\n\nBoth video and audio!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92559d1951302281ab1d6de60f766697486d4ee8","amp;dn":"Axwell+-+Mansion+-+March+28%2C+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92559d1951302281ab1d6de60f766697486d4ee8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,85,157,25,81,48,34,129,171,29,109,230,15,118,102,151,72,109,78,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
