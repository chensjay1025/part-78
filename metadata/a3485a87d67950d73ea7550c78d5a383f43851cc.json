But the film's main focus is on a new breed of Zodiac investigator ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ retirees, nurses, librarians, massage therapists, bakers, factory managers, pilots, interior decorators. These amateur detectives are dedicating vast amounts of their time and money to pursue a killer who, so far, has kept his promise to never be caught.\n\nAfter decades of frustration, hunting the Zodiac is barely a part-time job for the professional detectives. But for the amateurs, it's a full-time obsession.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3485a87d67950d73ea7550c78d5a383f43851cc","amp;dn":"Hunting.The.Zodiac.2007.DOCU.WEB.XviD-SiNGULARiTY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3485a87d67950d73ea7550c78d5a383f43851cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,72,90,135,214,121,80,215,62,167,85,12,120,213,163,131,244,56,81,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
