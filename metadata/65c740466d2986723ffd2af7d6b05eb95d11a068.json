The sisters, of course, are a good deal older than in Heart's '70s heyday, and their bandmates have changed, but the group's sound, led by Ann's powerful vocals and Nancy's instrumental versatility, hasn't changed much; that's a good thing for those who revel in the likes of &quot;Barracuda,&quot; &quot;Magic Man,&quot; and other oldies. There are several brand-new songs here as well, and the ongoing influence of Led Zeppelin is readily apparent, not only in the covers of Zep classics like &quot;Black Dog&quot; and &quot;The Battle of Evermore&quot; but also in Heart's commingling of pastoral acoustic sounds and hard rock. And after 19 songs, even the most ardent Heart lovers should be well satisfied. --Sam Graham\n\n\n\n\nDVD INFO\n\nSize: 5.40 Gb ( 5 663 916 KBytes ) - DVD-9\nEnabled regions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\nVideo: PAL 16:9 (720x576) VBR, Auto Pan&amp;Scan\nAudio:\nEnglish (Dolby AC3, 5 ch)\nEnglish (Dolby AC3, 2 ch)\nEnglish (DTS, 5 ch)\n\nMenu Video:\nPAL 16:9 (720x576) VBR\nAuto Pan&amp;Scan, Auto Letterboxed\nMenu Subtitles:\nNot specified\nMenu English Language Unit :\nRoot Menu","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65c740466d2986723ffd2af7d6b05eb95d11a068","amp;dn":"HEART+-+Alive+In+Seattle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65c740466d2986723ffd2af7d6b05eb95d11a068","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,199,64,70,109,41,134,114,63,253,42,247,214,176,94,185,93,17,160,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
