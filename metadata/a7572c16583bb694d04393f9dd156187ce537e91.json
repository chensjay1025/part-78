This team, led by Dr. Nicholas Rush and Colonel Everett Young, are trapped on the ship, unable to change its programmed mission, and encounter new races, new technology and new enemies, as the runaway ship takes them to the far ends of the Universe. \n\nFor those who don't know the show I included a 15minute Teaser/Trailer I made.\nIf you have indeed not seen anything Stargate related yet, go and get the whole thing - it is defenitly worth your while. Although it's not really necessary, you get a better understanding of what is going on with the background knowledge one gains through the complete stargate frenchise (SG1 and SG-Atlantis).\n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4216218/Stargate_SG-1_-_Season_1_to_10_%28Complete%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4216218/Stargate_SG-1_-_Season_1_to_10_%28Complete%29&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4639159/Stargate_Atlantis_ALL_Seasons_-_S01___S02___S03___S04___S05&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4639159/Stargate_Atlantis_ALL_Seasons_-_S01___S02___S03___S04___S05&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nFormat:\t\tXvid\nFile size:      358MiB avg per episode\nDuration: \t42min avg. per episode\nWidth: \t\t624 pixels\nHeight:\t\t352 pixels\nAspect ratio : \t16:9\nFrame rate : \t23.976 fps\nAudio: \t\tMP3\nNr. of Files:\t20 + 1 (15 minutes Teaser/Trailer by [man-o-tor])\n\nAll files properly named, keeping the original filenames intact, I don't take credit for what I didn't do!
