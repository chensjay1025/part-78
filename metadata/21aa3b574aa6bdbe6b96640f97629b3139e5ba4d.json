On the beat, the pair stumble upon a series of suspicious accidents and events.\n\n\nNicholas Angel is the finest cop London has to offer, with an arrest record 400% higher than any other officer on the force. He's so good, he makes everyone else look bad. As a result, Angel's superiors send him to a place where his talents won't be quite so embarrassing - the sleepy and seemingly crime-free village of Sandford. Once there, he is partnered with the well-meaning but overeager police officer Danny Butterman. The son of amiable Police Chief Frank Butterman, Danny is a huge action movie fan and believes his new big-city partner might just be a real-life &quot;bad boy,&quot; and his chance to experience the life of gunfights and car chases he so longs for. Angel is quick to dismiss this as childish fantasy and Danny's puppy-like enthusiasm only adds to Angel's growing frustration. However, as a series of grisly accidents rocks the village, Angel is convinced that Sandford is not what it seems and as the intrigue deepens, Danny's dreams of explosive, high-octane, car-chasing, gunfighting, all-out action seem more and more like a reality. It's time for these small-town cops to break out some big-city justice.\n\n\nCast\n\n\n\nSimon Pegg\t ...\tNicholas Angel\n\nMartin Freeman\t ...\tMet Sergeant\n\nBill Nighy\t ...\tMet Chief Inspector\n\t\nRobert Popper\t ...\t'Not' Janine\n\t\nJoe Cornish\t ...\tBob\n\nChris Waitt\t ...\tDave\n\nEric Mason\t ...\tBernard Cooper\n\nBillie Whitelaw\t ...\tJoyce Cooper\n\nNick Frost\t ...\tPC Danny Butterman\n\nPeter Wight\t ...\tRoy Porter\n\nJulia Deakin\t ...\tMary Porter\n\nTom Strode Walton\t ...\tUnderage Drinker #1\n\nTroy Woollan\t ...\tUnderage Drinker #2\n\nRory Lowings\t ...\tUnderage Drinker #3\n\nBill Bailey\t ...\tSergeant Turner\n\n\n\n**********************************************************************************************************************************************************************\n*************** COMMENTS ON AUDIO AND VIDEO PLZ GIRLS AND GUYS ********************\n***********************************************************************************\n***********************************************************************************","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21aa3b574aa6bdbe6b96640f97629b3139e5ba4d","amp;dn":"Hot+Fuzz+2007","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21aa3b574aa6bdbe6b96640f97629b3139e5ba4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,170,59,87,74,166,189,190,107,150,100,15,151,98,155,49,57,229,186,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
