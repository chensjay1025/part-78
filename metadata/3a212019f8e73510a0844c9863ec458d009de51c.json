Both songs were originally composed by Kalyanji Anandji and sung by Asha Bhosle. This song was remixed for The Black Eyed Peas' fifth studio album The E.N.D. as &quot;Don't Phunk Around.\n\nThe Black Eyed Peas acquired the rights for the songs from the music label Sa Re Ga Ma, the copyright holders of both songs, though they never got in touch with Anandji Virji Shah, the surviving member of the Kalyanji Anandji duo.\n\n\nThe Black Eyed Peas were nominated for two 2006 Grammy Awards for the song and won for &quot;Best Rap Performance By A Duo Or Group&quot;. The song also won the BMI Award, which was awarded to the Kalyanji Anandji brothers, for their compositions of &quot;Ye \nMera Dil&quot; and &quot;Ae Nujawan&quot; used as a basis for the song. The award was collected by Anandji Virji Shah, the surviving member of the duo.\n\n\nScreenshots::: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img138.imageshack.us/img138/2582/snapshot20100608124510.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img138.imageshack.us/img138/2582/snapshot20100608124510.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img24.imageshack.us/img24/4008/snapshot20100608124319.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img24.imageshack.us/img24/4008/snapshot20100608124319.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img249.imageshack.us/img249/3934/snapshot20100608124403.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img249.imageshack.us/img249/3934/snapshot20100608124403.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img33.imageshack.us/img33/2729/snapshot20100608124539.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img33.imageshack.us/img33/2729/snapshot20100608124539.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\nPlease pass on this collection to your friends and other people if you download it. \n\n\nIf you like this stuff, then the best way to say thanks is to seed it for sometime after your download completes.\n\nKeep the scene alive on open tracker sites!\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a212019f8e73510a0844c9863ec458d009de51c","amp;dn":"Black+Eyed+Peas+-+Don%5C%27t+Phunk+With+My+Heart+AVI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a212019f8e73510a0844c9863ec458d009de51c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,33,32,25,248,231,53,16,160,132,76,152,99,236,69,141,0,157,229,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
