Have you wondered what Peter would say if he talked for an hour...no phone calls, no commercials, in front of a group of Austrian Economists? Here it is and its pure heaven.\n\nOn March 13th 2009, Peter Schiff gave what I consider the all-time best lecture on the economy.  He explains the NASDAQ bubble/com bubble), Inflation, Sup-prime, securities, greed, reasons to let companies go bankrupt etc.\n\n It is all so clear, yet people refuse to listenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦.or watchÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦.or careÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦..but you will care.  \nYou will have no choice but to care.\n\nSo you might as well take 1 hour out of your life and learn something.\n\nI dare you.\n\nI dare you to not watch a sports game tonight, and watch this.\n\nI dare you watch this UNINTERUPTED with your UNDIVIDED attention. \n\nDonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t walk around in the kitchen with this in the background texting your fake friends that youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re to scared to talk to in real life about how many points Kobe Bryant scored last night. Watch this and shut the fuck up. If your brain hurts after 12 minutes of watching this and you lose interest, go watch MTV.  I think they have a new interview with a paper cup that Britney Spears drank out of in 2003.\n\n\n\nFORMAT is .FLV so you may watch it using a player like VLC Media Player.\n381 MB\n\nMP3 of this is located here http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5537360/why_the_meltdown_should_have_surprised_no_one.mp3\n\nSeed Forever","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8742a55c0f2d5aca269c259a655b14b52d5776b2","amp;dn":"Peter+Schiff-Why.the.Meltdown.Should.Have.Surprized.Nobody","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8742a55c0f2d5aca269c259a655b14b52d5776b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,66,165,92,15,45,90,202,38,156,37,154,101,91,20,181,45,87,118,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
