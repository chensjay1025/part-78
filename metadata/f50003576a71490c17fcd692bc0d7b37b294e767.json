Not only that, but some damned kid's found a weak spot in the Control Matrix and is messing with the whole scheme of things. The hammer of the New World Order hovers ready to strike, but the mind-controlled slaves are opening their eyes and scrambling out of the path of the chaos to come, while the alien Hive orchestrates its sinister endgame...\n\nA 'hard-boiled' tale of conspiracy-driven noir science-fiction about several victims of mind-control, an intelligence agent, an alien and a man who accidentally discovers an antidote to the coming global tyranny. \n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n&amp; now for the author's moment-of-truth: although it's presented as fiction, I believe that I've personally experienced many aspects of what I've written about in this book. Almost everything in here is actually going on--again, according to what I believe to be true.\n\nFor what it's worth, the solution I've presented (&amp; which is NOT my original idea) actually does work.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f50003576a71490c17fcd692bc0d7b37b294e767","amp;dn":"%28ebook+-+sci-fi%29+Autonomata-B.D.Schleinkofer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f50003576a71490c17fcd692bc0d7b37b294e767","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,0,3,87,106,113,73,12,23,252,214,146,188,13,123,55,178,148,231,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
