Following the rapid invasion of Earth by the alien race, the vast majority of humanity is exterminated, and the few survivors are enslaved and forced to fight in the ruins of Earth's cities for the entertainment of the Masters. A fictional planet Kullrathe is also invaded by the Masters, and its Minotaur-like inhabitants there are herded into concentration camps, then also forced to play the &quot;Hunter Hunted&quot; game for the entertainment of the aliens.\n\nScattered deep in the battle arenas are car parts which the game's two protagonists, Jake and Garathe Den, try to salvage, in order to construct a working vehicle and escape the Masters. The nature of Garathe and Jake's relationship is unclear in the game, as in some of the game's videos it appears that Garathe is hunting Jake down, and yet they appear to escape together in the hover car when all the car parts are found.\n\nInstallation:\nStart the installation process by running 'setup.exe'. After the installation has finished, run the game by using its executable. Use 'hhedit.exe' to start the Hunter Hunted level editor.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00f1a83c13c260fad0ab059098af05d7a05f98b1","amp;dn":"Hunter+Hunted","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00f1a83c13c260fad0ab059098af05d7a05f98b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,241,168,60,19,194,96,250,208,171,5,144,152,175,5,215,160,95,152,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
