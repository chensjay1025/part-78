Ana, a young woman in search of meaning and heroism, throws a rock at a tank, is imprisoned and raped; her lover Jacques is shot, and the cop who shot him becomes Ana's love slave. Traveling to Mexico, Ana is transformed into a dominatrix who deals drugs and shoots people for kicks; returning to Paris, she becomes a rich industrialist's mistress. Is Ana resisting oppression? Is she taking revenge on men for her rape? Is she an ant in a meaningless cosmos?\n\n\nLÃƒÂ³pez began his career in 1953 working for the publishing house Columba where he illustrated the series Perico y Guillerma. Working for Editorial Abril he met HÃƒÂ©ctor GermÃƒÂ¡n Oesterheld, assigned to illustrate his series Bull Rocket for the magazine Misterix. They collaborated on the series Pablo Maran and Uma-Uma, before joining to start Oesterheld's publishing house Editorial Frontera. For the Frontera first publication of the monthly Hora Cero, the team produced the series Rolo el marciano adoptivo and El HÃƒÂ©roe.[3] LÃƒÂ³pez also alternated as artist on the Ernie Pike series with Hugo Pratt, Jorge Moliterni and JosÃƒÂ© MuÃƒÂ±oz.[4] On September 4, 1957 in the publication of Hora Cero Suplemento Semanal, the science-fiction series El Eternauta made its first appearance.\nA success, El Eternauta came to the attention of the authorities as the series featured commentary of the political situation of Argentina and neighbouring Chile, prompting LÃƒÂ³pez to flee for Spain to avoid possible arrest. In 1959 LÃƒÂ³pez began working for Fleetway in Madrid and later London, producing artwork for a host of series, including Galaxus: The Thing from Outer Space, Pete's Pocket Army, The Drowned World, Janus Stark, and Kelly's Eye.\nHaving returned to Argentina, LÃƒÂ³pez resumed collaboration with Oesterheld on El Eternauta II in 1968 with a new publishing house, Editorial Records. He also started work on science-fiction saga Slot-Barr with writer Ricardo Barreiro, and the police series Evaristo with Carlos Sampayo. In the late 70s LÃƒÂ³pez again fled Argentina following persecution from the authorities, and from Madrid he arranged the publication of both El Eternauta and Slot-Barr with the Italian magazines LancioStory and Skorpio.\nIn the 90s, Solano Lopez produced work in the erotic comics genre, achieving hits with El ProstÃƒÂ­bulo del Terror, from a story by Barreiro, and Silly Symphony, made for the magazine Kiss Comix.\nSolano LÃƒÂ³pez died on August 12, 2011 from a cerebral hemorrhage.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5462e3addba500f12b6ee458a480e6ffd2a0e1eb","amp;dn":"Francisco+Solano+Lopez%3A+Ana+%28Fantragraphics%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5462e3addba500f12b6ee458a480e6ffd2a0e1eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,98,227,173,219,165,0,241,43,110,228,88,164,128,230,255,210,160,225,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
