He thinks all that's ahead is an easy payday, but when Nicole gives him the slip so she can chase a lead on a murder cover-up, Milo realizes that nothing ever goes simply with him and Nicole. The exes continually one-up each other - until they find themselves on the run for their lives. They thought their promise to love, honor and obey was tough - staying alive is going to be a whole lot tougher.\n\n\nSome of the blur is fixed and the next upload will have a much better audio. we are working on it right now.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41ce8b1096b95163f8e066d4252531d515d8460d","amp;dn":"The.Bounty.Hunter%5B2010%5DTS.NeRoZ.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41ce8b1096b95163f8e066d4252531d515d8460d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,206,139,16,150,185,81,99,248,224,102,212,37,37,49,213,21,216,70,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
