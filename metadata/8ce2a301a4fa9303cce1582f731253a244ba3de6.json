Vassar Clements originally wrote the basic melody an octave lower, in a tune called &quot;Lonesome Fiddle Blues&quot;. The Charlie Daniels Band moved it up an octave and put words to it. The song's verses are closer to being spoken rather than sung (i.e. chant or Sprechstimme), and tell the story of a boy named Johnny, who one day is challenged by the devil to a battle of fiddle-playing: If Johnny triumphs, he claims a golden fiddle; losing the battle will forfeit his soul. The performances of Satan and Johnny are played as instrumental bridges.\n\nThe song was the band's biggest pop hit, reaching number three on the Billboard Hot 100. The song was featured in the movie Urban Cowboy. The choreographer of the film, Patsy Swayze claims that she set the tempo to the song. &quot;How fast can you dance it?,&quot; Daniels said. &quot;How fast can you play it?,&quot; Swayze said in return.\n\nThe song is a narrative about the Devil, who comes to Georgia to procure souls. He has not obtained any recently, and is willing to &quot;make a deal&quot; out of desperation. He happens upon a young fiddle player named Johnny, who is minding his own business and playing impressively. The Devil approaches Johnny, and informs him that he, too, plays the fiddle. He then decides to challenge Johnny to a fiddle-playing contest, confident that he is more skillful than the young boy. The terms of the duel are that should Johnny win, he will be given a fiddle made of solid gold, but should the Devil triumph, he gains Johnny's soul. Although he believes taking the Devil's bet might be sinful, Johnny accepts the terms, proudly telling the Devil that the Devil will regret it as Johnny is &quot;the best there's ever been&quot;. The duel commences, with the Devil performing a sinister and powerful piece with the backing of demon musicians. Despite this, the Devil is squarely defeated when Johnny takes his turn to perform. The Devil acknowledges being bested and, true to his word, the Devil presents Johnny with a beautiful golden fiddle. Johnny boastfully informs the Devil that he is welcome anytime to come back for a rematch.\n\nMillion Mile Reflections is a studio album by The Charlie Daniels Band released on April 20, 1979. It is best known for the hit single The Devil Went Down to Georgia. The title refers to the band having passed the million mile mark in its touring. The song Reflections is a tribute to Elvis Presley, Janis Joplin, and Ronnie Van Zant. Daniels dedicated the album to Van Zant, who had died in October, 1977 in a plane crash.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ce2a301a4fa9303cce1582f731253a244ba3de6","amp;dn":"Charlie+Daniels+-+Devil+Went+Down+To+Georgia+%28Live%29+%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ce2a301a4fa9303cce1582f731253a244ba3de6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,226,163,1,164,250,147,3,204,225,88,47,115,18,83,162,68,186,61,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
