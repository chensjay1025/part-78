In\nrecognition of this, Neilsen SoundScan named him their Artist of the Decade.\nRelapse entered the charts at #1 and, at nearly double platinum, was the best\nselling rap album of last year. It also earned Eminem his 11th Grammy award,\nwinning in the Best Rap Album category. Relapse's first single, &quot;Crack A Bottle&quot;\nfrom Eminem, Dr. Dre and 50 Cent, soared to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100\n(Eminem's second #1 after 2002's &quot;Lose Yourself&quot;) and set a SoundScan record at\nthe time of its release for opening week download sales (418,000). The album\nalso spun off two other hits; the Top 10 &quot;We Made You&quot; and Top 20 &quot;Beautiful.&quot;\n\n&quot;I had originally planned for Relapse 2 to come out last year,&quot; remarked EMINEM.\n&quot;But as I kept recording and working with new producers, the idea of a sequel to\nRelapse started to make less and less sense to me, and I wanted to make a\ncompletely new album. The music on Recovery came out very different from\nRelapse, and I think it deserves its own title.&quot;\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\nInfo:\n\nLike it? Buy it!
