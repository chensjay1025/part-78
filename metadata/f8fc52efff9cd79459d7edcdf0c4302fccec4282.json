BotswanaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mysterious Savuti Channel. Where the prey is plentiful and the pickings are easyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦but the banquet is crowded. Three groups abound in this predator battleground ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the lion pride, hyena clan and wild dog pack ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ all using the dry riverbed as a hunting ground. While the dry season plagues the elephant and antelope herds, it makes for a predators delight.\nBut then when heavy rains come from Angola flooding the Savuti Channel for the first time in 25 years, crocodiles seize the channel as their own. Witness the resulting unique behaviour of predator and prey alike as the dry and the wet channel forces them to react in startling ways, the predators who use it as a hunting ground must battle to retain their territory. All in an effort to survive on the Savuti Predator Battleground.\nWhich predators will adjust to the now flowing Savuti channel, and which will not? Will there be a bloody battle as they compete for their positions? Which predator will ultimately dominate the Savuti Predator Battleground?\n\nTHANKS TO ASA\n\n\nHOMEPAGE http://natgeotv.com/u","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8fc52efff9cd79459d7edcdf0c4302fccec4282","amp;dn":"National..Geographic.Predator+.Battleground","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8fc52efff9cd79459d7edcdf0c4302fccec4282","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,252,82,239,255,156,215,148,89,215,237,205,240,196,48,47,204,236,66,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
