British narrator Gerard Doyle's reading makes the story sound so nightmarish and real that it's deeply disturbing. Doyle's voice is steeped in panic and desperation, forcing the listener to adopt his cause no matter how high the stakes. DoyleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s expert portrayal reminds us how transcendent audiobooks can be. \n\nL.B.
