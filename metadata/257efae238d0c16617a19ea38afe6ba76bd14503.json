Song selections include &quot;Toys In The Attic,&quot; &quot;Hang Man Jury,&quot; &quot;Big 10 Inch,&quot; &quot;Dream On,&quot; &quot;Walkin' The Dog,&quot; and &quot;Train Kept A Rollin'.&quot; &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; with Aerosmith, with high definition imaging by Captain of America, marks the first airing of a high definition program on the network.\n\nAn excerpt from the MTV Unplugged book.....&quot;Despite the family entertainment angle, the boys were still boys. Aerosmith has never been a band to shy away from extreme, sometime slightly juvenile, sexual innuendo. But the painting of a topless woman on Joey Kramer's drum kit was a bit much for our television censors. We needed a solution and we needed it fast. Finally, in a flash of genius that was born of complete panic, we bought a set of pasties and attached them to the bass drum. Every time Joey hit his kit, the pasties would twirl. The band, of course, was more than a little pleased.\n\nPlease seed after you download it, and don't forget to leave your comments, that encourage me to upload more cool stuff.\n\nLong live Rock n Roll......... m/\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:257efae238d0c16617a19ea38afe6ba76bd14503","amp;dn":"Aerosmith+-+MTV+Unplugged+Video+By+AeRoMaNiAc","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"257efae238d0c16617a19ea38afe6ba76bd14503","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,126,250,226,56,208,193,102,23,161,158,163,138,254,107,167,107,209,69,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
