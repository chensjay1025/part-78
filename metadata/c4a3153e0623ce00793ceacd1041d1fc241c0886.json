Elizabeth Elmore is a true triple threat: a gifted composer, an acute lyricist, and a nakedly honest vocalist, her songs come fast and furious, but no amount of barbed-wire guitars can obscure the poignancy and desperation of standout tracks like &quot;Stall&quot; and &quot;Charms and Feigns.&quot; And for all of Sarge's indie defiance, it's clear Elmore's misspent youth also included a steady diet of arena schlock -- her songs are built around unashamedly meaty riffs, and the wonderful &quot;Beguiling&quot; could even very well be the first real air-guitar song for riot-grrrls. The cumulative result is that regardless of labels -- punk, indie, whatever -- The Glass Intact is at heart a rock &amp; roll album in the classic sense: cathartic, impassioned, and vividly alive. \n\nFormat: CD\nReleased: 1999\nLabel: Mud Records\nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Indie Rock\nQuality: FLAC\nAllmusic rating: 4.5 / 5 stars\n\nTracks:\n\n   1.
