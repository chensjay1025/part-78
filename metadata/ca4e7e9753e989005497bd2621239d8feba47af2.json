The group's debut EP, EPrime, drew favorable reviews and comparisons to everybody from the Flaming Lips to Pink Floyd and Aphex Twin. Woven's signature blend of art rock, trip-hop, and electronica was even more apparent on their full-length debut for Interscope, 8 Bit Monk. The band's sophomore release, Designer Codes, arrived in 2008. ~ James Christopher Monger, All Music Guide\n\nTrack listing\n1. Beautiful\n2. Tesion\n3. Steady\n4. Who Knows\n5.
