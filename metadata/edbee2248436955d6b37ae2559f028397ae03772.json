His musical style is often considered a blend of Southern Rock, blues, and traditional country. He is the son of country music pioneer Hank Williams Sr., and the father of Hank Williams III, Holly Williams, Hilary Williams, Samuel Williams and Katie Williams. Sam is expected to start recording officially in 2010.\nWilliams began his career imitating his famed father. His style gradually evolved, until he was involved in a near fatal fall off the side of a mountain, which apparently changed his personal and professional life. After an extended recovery, he challenged the country music establishment with a blend of country, rock, and blues. After some success in the 1980s, Williams earned considerable recognition and popularity. He is now considered an elder statesman of the country and outlaw country genres.\nAs a multi-instrumentalist, Williams' repertoire of skills include guitar, bass guitar, upright bass, steel guitar, banjo, Dobro, piano, keyboards, harmonica, fiddle, and drums.[1]\n\nPlease SEED and enjoy, thanks........!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:edbee2248436955d6b37ae2559f028397ae03772","amp;dn":"Hank+Williams+Jr-Almeria+Club-2002","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"edbee2248436955d6b37ae2559f028397ae03772","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,190,226,36,132,54,149,93,107,55,174,37,89,240,40,57,122,224,55,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
