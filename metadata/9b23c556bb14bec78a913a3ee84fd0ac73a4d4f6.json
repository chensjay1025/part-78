The King has become jealous of Rudolf Rassendyll and suspicious of the queen (Flavia)ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s feelings towards him. Flavia decides that this must be the last year in which she sends to Rudolf the single red rose that betokens her love, and therefore she also sends via Fritz von Tarlenheim, her letter of good-bye.\n\nCount Rupert of Hentzau, banished from Ruritania after the incidents of the earlier book, is plotting his return. In furtherance of his scheme he obtains both letter and rose, and plots to place them before the King.

These files can have chapter markers which can be skipped through as you would skip through files on a play list. They can have built in cover art and chapter images. They will remember where you left off each time you stop the file and come back to it . And variable speed settings on Ipods and a growing number of other mp3 players can be utilized by this file type. The ability to bookmark allows for as little as one large file instead of many small ones without the burden of fast forwarding to find your spot every time you resume listening or the fear of otherwise losing your place. The reduced number of files also makes browsing through your files to find your book and your place in it much less effort.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b23c556bb14bec78a913a3ee84fd0ac73a4d4f6","amp;dn":"Librivox+M4B+Audiobook+-+Prisoner+of+Zenda+and+Rupert+of+Hentzau","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b23c556bb14bec78a913a3ee84fd0ac73a4d4f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,35,197,86,187,20,190,199,138,145,58,62,232,79,208,172,115,164,212,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
