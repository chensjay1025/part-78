Other guests include Bill Murphy [hour 2], a financial commentator and founder of the Gold Anti-Trust Action Committee, top editorial photographer Dan Winters [hour 3], and former New Jersey Superior Court Judge and political and legal analyst for Fox News Channel, Andrew Napolitano [hour 4].\n\n\n\nNOTE :: As with yesterday's show Paul Joseph Watson fills in during the 1st hour as guest-host for Alex [who is &quot;out of town working on a project&quot;].\nOnly the first hour is live.  The other three hours consist of previously broadcast interviews with the people listed above.\nBob Chapman is on during the first 5 minutes of hour 3.\nTed Anderson -- owner of GCN Radio Network -- breaks in at the end of hour 2 to do a live 5 minute commercial for his gold business, Midas Resources.\nLIke yesterday, the audio quality of the last three hours was less than great.\n\nAlex is supposed to be back tomorrow: Wednesday, June 16th.\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_torrents_info_PLEASE-READ.txt\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n\n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance.
