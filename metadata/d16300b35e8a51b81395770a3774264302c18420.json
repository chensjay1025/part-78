There are some intriguingly obscure numbers, like Spanish band Mercromina's &quot;Evolution&quot; and under-documented Bill Fox's &quot;Electrocution&quot;. It also features tracks by The Go-Betweens, Arthur Russell, Spoon, and more. This record will be released on June 8th, but the band is making copies available early for Record Store Day.\n\n\t\n1.
