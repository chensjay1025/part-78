Rocking Horse rocked as usual and Empty Pages got the crowd fired up. Cranking up some old favorites, Banks Of The Deep End and Don't Step On The Grass Sam led into some not so common tunes such as Raven Black Night, I'm So Tired and Don't Let It Break You Down. Kenny Brooks ands his sax came out and blew it out during Sco-Mule and the melding of When Doves Cry and Beautifully Broken was glorious. Not heard in many a show, Almost Cut My Hair was a crowd pleasing surprise as was Warren's vocal tease of Ain't No Sunshine during the opening strains of Blind Man In the Dark. With a sated crowd still wanting more, the band left the stage after delivering a stirring Soulshine to a thankful house.\n\nDisc 1 \n\n01. Jam in C#\n02. Lucky\n03. Rocking Horse\n04.
