His three uncles know otherwise and make\n        him take a clan test. Of course he fails, and is exiled until he can\n        pull himself together. On his travels Chan meets up with many staff-\n        wielding allies and foes. Romance is also in the air when he saves the\n        beautiful double-stick damsel Yu Yun from marrying the idiot son of\n        the sworn enemy of his family.\n\n        Northerner Liu Ta Yeh is on the warpath and plans to smash the Chan\n        household. The young master rushes home to find that he is too late.\n        Most of his uncles and servant have been killed by Liu's mouse tail\n        stick, and Liu has left a note for Chan challenging him to deadly\n        staff combat in the bamboo grove. Can the young prodigal defeat the\n        might of the white-haired northerner, or will he come to a sticky end?\n\n        RiPPERS NOTES:\n\n        More oldschool goodness coming your way.
