The inquiry, which published its findings \nyesterday, found that the British army soldiers did not shoot in response to \nthe threat of lethal violence from protesters. Rather, the victims were unarmed\ncivilians, shot while fleeing from soldiers or going to the help of others.  \n\nThe report is available as a series of web pages from &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://report.bloody-sunday-inquiry.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://report.bloody-sunday-inquiry.org/&lt;/a&gt;\nWe have scraped these pages and converted the report into 10 pdfs, one for each\nvolume of the printed report. We hope this is useful to anyone who wants to \nprint the report, read it in an ereader or archive it.\n\nWe have tried to make sure that the conversion from html to pdf has been done\naccurately, but please let us know if you find any problems (which are not in\nthe original webpage). We will consider doing the same thing for the\ntranscripts of the hearing and the other evidence published by the inquiry if\nenough people would find it useful. contact us at &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;3651445943405344421855595a5a5355425f405376515b575f5a1855595b&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fbc48f3e1aaf800e8eb6817c0d6804030adcf620","amp;dn":"Report+of+the+Bloody+Sunday+Inquiry","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fbc48f3e1aaf800e8eb6817c0d6804030adcf620","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,196,143,62,26,175,128,14,142,182,129,124,13,104,4,3,10,220,246,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
