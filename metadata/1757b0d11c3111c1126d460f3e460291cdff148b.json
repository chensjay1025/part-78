Jack is a sound-man who works on &quot;Grade-B&quot; horror movies. Late one evening, he is &quot;sampling&quot; sounds for use on his movies, when he hears something unexpected through his sound equipment and records it. Curiosity gets the better of him when the media become involved, and he begins to unravel the pieces of a nefarious conspiracy. As he struggles to survive against his shadowy enemies and expose the truth, he doesn't know who he can trust. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082085/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082085/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLanguages:   English/German/French/Italian/Spanish.\n\nSubtitles:   French/Italian/Spanish/Dutch.\n\nPlease seed when downloading finish.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1757b0d11c3111c1126d460f3e460291cdff148b","amp;dn":"Blow+Out+%281981%29+pal+dvd9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1757b0d11c3111c1126d460f3e460291cdff148b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,87,176,209,28,49,17,193,18,109,70,15,62,70,2,145,205,255,20,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
