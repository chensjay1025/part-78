Check them out here:\n\nThey are a screamo band, they're 320kbps files. They're independent and rely on their tour for money. See if they're coming to a place near you and check them out.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc7d93f8a2f0ec13821db68e0cd3cfd0ce1f76d0","amp;dn":"We%5C%27re+Wolves%3A+Demo+CD+-+Ligar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc7d93f8a2f0ec13821db68e0cd3cfd0ce1f76d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,125,147,248,162,240,236,19,130,29,182,142,12,211,207,208,206,31,118,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
