Wilted, broken, skeletal. In the tradition of the Byrds, the Flying Burrito Brothers, the Velvet Underground, Frank Zappa - Ox is the incarnation of deconstructed pop &amp; vintage indie from the fertile sils of the Canadian heartland. A reflection of middle-america - where trash and beauty meet - a musical liquor store heist that will leave a distinct flavour of dust in your mouth. Studio weary fragments, fragile masterpieces, sonic accidents ... 'lo-fi' at its best.\n\nThis EP features features 4 new songs from Ox.\n\n\n\n**************************************************************************************************************************\n\n\nAbout Kid Lightning:\n\nKID LIGHTNING | LOS ANGELES | USA\n\nAfter years of churning out perfectly polished pop-rock for cult-heroes Gigilo Aunts, singer Dave Gibbs, aka: Kid Lightning, releases his debut CD, Her Smallest Breath Is Full Of Grace, a home-made sound track to a heart falling apart. Warts and all, he takes you through the 5 stages of grieving, then adds: 6) poking; 7) stalking; and finally, moving to a new city for good measure.\n\nThis EP includes 2 songs from the Kid's album, one of which is a hidden track Dave now wishes he hadn't hidden, plus two previously unreleased tracks.\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\nOx:\n\n1 Miss Idaho\n2 Surrender (Cheap Trick cover)\n3 Sugar Cane\n4 El Camino (pt 1)\n\n\nKid Lightning:\n\n5 I'm not the One (Cars cover)\n6 Back To You\n7 Barely Out of Tuesday\n8 Lullaby for Griffin\n\n\n\n\nENJOY &amp; REMEMBER TO KEEP SEEDING FOR OTHERS!!!\nTHANKS!!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9da6604ed2118785f6453b52f68dc947d97b52e","amp;dn":"OX+%2B+Kid+Lightning+-+IPX+No.6+%282004%29%28Indie+Alternative+Folk+Rock","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9da6604ed2118785f6453b52f68dc947d97b52e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,218,102,4,237,33,24,120,95,100,83,181,47,104,220,148,125,151,181,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
