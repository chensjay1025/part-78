Led by their priestess Amiel, the Ceveans constructed the Ark in an attempt to flee their world, but the Ark was ceased by the Storrions, enslaving some of the Ceveans and banishing the rest to the wastelands. The priestess Amiel vanished. Too late the Storrions realized that they needed the priestess to move the Ark and so they keep searching the wastelands for a sign of her... Building on the techniques of &quot;Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within&quot; and enriching them with a unique storyline, this South Korean animation draws you into the world of Alcyone to witness the struggle between Ceveans and Storrions and a world in ruins.\n\nCast\n\n\nChiara Zanni\t... \tAmarinth (voice)\nKirby Morrow\t... \tRogan (voice)\nJames Woods\t... \tJallak (voice)\nTrevor Devall\t... \tBaramanda (voice)\nKathleen Barr\t... \tPiriel (voice)\nTabitha St. Germain\t... \tEmpress Cathebel (voice)\nGerard Plunkett\t... \tMinister Eserbus (voice)\nFiona Hogan\t... \tDr. Anders (voice)\nJason Simpson\t... \tHiggins (voice)\nSandy Fox\t... \tJejune (voice)\nRichard Newman\t... \tUmada (voice)\nScott McNeil\t... \tQuinn (voice)\nTy Olsson\t... \tLorris (voice)\nBrian Dobson\t... \tBurke (voice)\nTim Owens\t... \tKiskin (voice)\n\n\nVideo\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Custom\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                    : XviD\nDuration                         : 1h 29mn\nBit rate                         : 2 848 Kbps\nWidth                            : 720 pixels\nHeight                           : 544 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 4:3\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\n\n\nAudio\n\nFormat                           : AC-3\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Coding 3\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 192 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nChannel positions                : Front: L R\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4994b9d4614e3011c9636a8b855eb000aec9c84","amp;dn":"Ark+%282004%29.avi%5Beyesofflys%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4994b9d4614e3011c9636a8b855eb000aec9c84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,153,75,157,70,20,227,1,28,150,54,168,184,85,235,0,10,236,156,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
