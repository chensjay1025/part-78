The show features all three of the band's principal singer-writers: guitarist Tom Johnston, who fronted the early, hard-rocking hits like &quot;Listen to the Music,&quot; &quot;China Grove,&quot; and &quot;Long Train Running&quot; (all performed here, of course, to rapturous audience response); keyboardist Michael McDonald, who replaced Johnston in the mid-'70s and whose superb voice and blue-eyed soul influence resulted in perhaps their finest single hit, &quot;What a Fool Believes&quot; (included here as part of a segment recorded in Nashville); and guitarist Patrick Simmons, who provided a more folkie-acoustic influence (ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â  la &quot;Black Water&quot;) and spanned both the Johnston and McDonald eras. The Doobie Brothers' harmony singing is spot-on, the playing is righteous, the band rocks, there's plenty of interview material between songs (and a music-only option for those who prefer to get right to the point)... and to top it off, some of the proceeds of which go the Wildlife Conservation Society.\n\n\n# Actors: The Doobie Brothers, Michael Hossack, Tom Johnston, Keith Knudsen, Michael McDonald\n# Directors: Ernie Fritz\n# Producers: Andy Kadison, Bruce R.
