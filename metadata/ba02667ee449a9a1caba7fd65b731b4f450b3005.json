A three piece comprised of the haunting and fragile-voiced Sarah Nixey, Auteurs henchman Luke Haines and absinthe importer (&amp; former Jesus &amp; Mary Chain) John Moore. Stylistally, the band have catapulted themselves into some netherworld halfway between Air and Velvet Underground. Instruments include, Guitar arpeggios, synthesizers, glockenspiels, chiming xylophones, strings and drum machines.\n\nAlbum review\nThe songs here obsess with unnerving clarity and mordant wit on the banal, cruel details of human relationships and are narrated perfectly by Nixey. Where her perfectly English-accented whisper infused England Made Me with the air of a bored aristocrat finding contemptuous amusement in the misery of others, on The Facts of Life she has located an edge of taunting viciousness all the more diabolical for being so understated. The tunes, as ever, are sweet and insidious, perhaps best thought of as Saint Etienne turned feral. Highlights on an album full of them are &quot;English Motorway&quot; and &quot;The Art of Driving&quot;--BBR triumphantly reclaiming the American rock &amp; roll prerogative of the road song for their damp, claustrophobic homeland. The Facts of Life is a masterpiece","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba02667ee449a9a1caba7fd65b731b4f450b3005","amp;dn":"Black+Box+Recorder+-+The+Facts+of+Life+%5B2000%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba02667ee449a9a1caba7fd65b731b4f450b3005","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,2,102,126,228,73,169,161,202,186,127,214,91,115,27,79,69,11,48,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
