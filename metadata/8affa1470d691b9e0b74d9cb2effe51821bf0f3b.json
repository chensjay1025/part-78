His curious figure among the sheeps in the urban area catches the attention of everyone who is passing by. I choose it basically for the interest in the visual environment.\n\nMy influences were basically the movies of Jia Zhang-ke, Hou Hsiao-Hsien, Johan van der Keuken, Cao GuimarÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â£es and of course, Maria Augusta Ramos.\nToday I think it's like Kiarostami's &quot;Five&quot;, Raymond Depardon's &quot;Profils paysans&quot; and the Wang Bing movies.\n\nThere are several problems that may bother any viewer.\nThe sound recording was very troubled, considering our past difficulties and inexperience in handling the equipment and so the few dialogues are difficult to understand. But it doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t matter what the characters actually say, but the fact that they interact with each other and talk nonsense.\n\nIt is basically a film school assignment, an experimental short film, but today I really like it ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ considering my goals and the context in which it was produced. I'm happy with the film and satisfied with all the work we've had. It was a great learning experience.\n\nHere is a good and accurate review (in Portuguese): link\n\nRecorded in November 2008 and finished in May 2009.\nSony HVR-Z1, 1440x1080i, miniDV.\nEdited in Final Cut Pro\n\n\n\nSo,\nI hope you enjoy it.\nAnd spread the experience.\n\nShare as much as possible.\nThank you.\n\nAlexandre Rafael Garcia\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;345558514c555a5046510707745359555d581a575b59&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8affa1470d691b9e0b74d9cb2effe51821bf0f3b","amp;dn":"Pastoreio.Shepherding.2009.HDV.720p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8affa1470d691b9e0b74d9cb2effe51821bf0f3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,255,161,71,13,105,27,158,11,116,217,203,46,255,229,24,33,191,15,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
