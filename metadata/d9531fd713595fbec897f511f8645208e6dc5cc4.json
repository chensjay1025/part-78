There she is: a small middle-aged woman. No, wait: the killer is the timid man beside her. Now its someone else. It's all and none of them. Because the murderer Hobbes seeks is a demon passing from one human host to another with a brush of an overcoat or touch of a hand.\n\nHobbes stalks a seemingly immortal foe in 'Fallen', an intense thriller co-starring John Goodman and Donald Sutherland. An ages-old evil faces a shattering showdown with one clever tenacious man.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9531fd713595fbec897f511f8645208e6dc5cc4","amp;dn":"FALLEN-2006+IN+XVID-AC3+5.1+BY+JOCKTHERIPPER%40KIDZCORNER","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9531fd713595fbec897f511f8645208e6dc5cc4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,83,31,215,19,89,95,190,200,151,245,17,248,100,82,8,230,220,92,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
