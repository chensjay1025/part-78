Rush switches bodies with Telford and is captured by the Lucian Alliance and who discovered another Icarus planet and plan to connect their Stargate to the one onboard Destiny. Young interrogates Telford and Greer beats Telford. Eventually General O'Neil visits the Destiny and it is discovered that Telford was brainwashed using Goa'uld technology.
