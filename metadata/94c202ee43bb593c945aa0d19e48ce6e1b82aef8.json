This is a collection of Traditional Irish Drinking songs (as well as a few originals in that style) that Murphy grew up listening to and playing with his older brother. The sound is complete with bag pipes, Uilleann Pipes, violin, banjo, mandolin, and Bodrahn. Best if listened to with a frosty pint! \n\nI waited for this torrent to show up for a long time before i finally just bowed down and bought the album, if you like this band or are a Wookiefoot fan at all please buy the album, the band gives most of their money to charity anyways!\n\nAlbum uploaded at 320kbps, MP3 enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94c202ee43bb593c945aa0d19e48ce6e1b82aef8","amp;dn":"Murphy%5C%27s+Empty+Shot+-+Tower+of+Babel+Falls","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94c202ee43bb593c945aa0d19e48ce6e1b82aef8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,194,2,238,67,187,89,60,148,90,160,209,158,72,206,110,27,130,174,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
