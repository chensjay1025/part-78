The band's hits included a remake of the Drifters' 1961 hit, &quot;Sweets for My Sweet&quot;; remakes of Jackie DeShannon's &quot;Needles and Pins&quot; and &quot;When You Walk In The Room&quot;; an original song written for them, &quot;Sugar and Spice&quot;; The Orlons' &quot;Don't Throw Your Love Away&quot;; and a remake of The Clovers' &quot;Love Potion No. 9&quot;. They were the second group from Liverpool, after the Beatles, to have a hit in the United States when &quot;Needles and Pins&quot; charted during the first week of March 1964.
