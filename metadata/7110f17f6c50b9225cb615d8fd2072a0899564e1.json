Larry and          \n         Melissa are not only committed to their 13 children,          \n         but also to their surrounding communities. The entire         \n         family play an active role in their community and             \n         dedicate time to the needy and to taking care of the          \n         elderly. But in September of 2008, Hurricane Ike swept        \n         across the Texas Gulf Coast and left the Beach family         \n         home in shambles. Adding insult to injury, their storage      \n         unit flooded and destroyed all of their belongings. With      \n         mounting medical bills, they're unable to make any of the     \n         repairs necessary to move their family back into their        \n          home - so they are all living together in a small trailer.    \n                                                                       \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n       \n         Release  Notes    \n                                     \n                                        \n                                                                  \n                                                                     \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n       \n          Group Greets     \n                                     \n                                        \n                                                                  \n                                                                     \n                           CTU, ORENJi, 2HD, DHD                       \n                                                                        \n            and all other groups that choose quality over speed         \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n        \n       Contact Info      \n                                      \n                                        \n                                                                  \n       We are currently looking for:                                  \n                                                                       \n           * US/CA cappers with HDTV and/or DSR feed - min 60 kB/s      \n                                                                        \n         GROUP NEWS: No, we will not affil your brand new/DR/colo site, \n                     so please don't ask.
