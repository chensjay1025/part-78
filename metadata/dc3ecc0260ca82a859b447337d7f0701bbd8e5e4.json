It includes The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker, Timesplitters Future Perfect, and Alien Hominid. I've also included the Wind Waker maps because of the game crashing when you go into a dungeon and open your map.\n\nHow to Use:\nBurn ISO at 2x-4x speed using your software of choice to a DVD-R, then load on your Wii using a modchip or softmod(Personally I recommend Darkcorp), then select the game using the Gamecube D-Pad, then press A and it should run.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc3ecc0260ca82a859b447337d7f0701bbd8e5e4","amp;dn":"%5BGamecube%5D%5BNTSC%5D%5BMulti-game%5DTimesplitters%3A+FP%2C+Zelda%3A+WW%2C+Alien+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc3ecc0260ca82a859b447337d7f0701bbd8e5e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,62,204,2,96,202,130,168,89,180,71,51,125,127,7,1,187,216,229,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
