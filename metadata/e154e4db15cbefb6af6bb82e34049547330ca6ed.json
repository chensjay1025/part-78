In short, I was first clued in to Teenage Brain Surgeon's existence by fantastic fashion guru and DJ Jeralyn, who runs I'll Wear Any Color as Long as It's Black. We were only able to track down 2/3rds of their sparse discography, but I was fortunate enough to stumble upon the final, elusive track in my late-night travels. Huzzah! \n\nThere's virtually no information available about this German band, as this is their lone release. The limited edition 7'' (1,000 copies are said to be in existence) was self-released in 1988. Extremely rare, but extremely solid, all three of these tracks are ripe for the dance floor, chock full of infectious electronics and a stomping beat. The title track is especially choice, and never fails me in a DJ set. \n\nIf anyone out there has any information whatsoever regarding this band, feel free to chime in! Otherwise, let's get to the good stuff, shall we?\n\n\n\nTeenage Brain Surgeon- Fatal Day 7''\n1. Fatal Day\n2. Years Gone By\n3. Cold\n\n\nNext up, we have a rare compilation of Zwischenfall as well as another generous donation from Jeff! Stay tuned for more over the next few days.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e154e4db15cbefb6af6bb82e34049547330ca6ed","amp;dn":"Teenage+Brain+Surgeon+-+Fatal+Day+7%5C%27%5C%27+%281988%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e154e4db15cbefb6af6bb82e34049547330ca6ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,84,228,219,21,203,239,182,175,107,184,46,52,4,149,71,51,12,166,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
