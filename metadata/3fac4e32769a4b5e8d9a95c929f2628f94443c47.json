Steven realizes he's gay and decides to live life to the fullest - even if it means breaking the law. Steven's new, extravagant lifestyle involves cons and fraud and, eventually, a stay in the State Penitentiary where he meets sensitive, soft-spoken Phillip Morris. His devotion to freeing Phillip from jail and building the perfect life together prompts Steven to attempt and often succeed at one impossible con after another.\n\nAudio : English DD 5.1 - 448 Kbps\n\nSubs : English, Spanish, French, Dutch, Portuguese, Brazil, Romanian, Arabic, Serbian, Bulgarian, Czech, Greek, Chinese x 2, Polish\n\nNTSC\n\nRegular DVDR converted from a BluRayRip , playable on a standalone dvd player\n\nEng/Fre sub is retail.
