Great actors, great production design, great images. It is nice to watch because you feel you are in the capable hands of Ridley Scott. But do not expect to be amazed by the story or the acting. Apart from dame Marion, the characters are two dimensional and predictable. The film pretends to be historically correct, but is of course a well dressed fantasy. There are a few battle scenes, filmed in the Gladiator way. They are exciting, but not very convincing. In fact, they are completely ridiculous when you think you are watching a historically correct film. The worst for me were the boats in the final battle, apparently trying to induce a D-Day feeling. \n\nOverall, the story is off balance. Some scenes have a very slow pace, while other scenes, often key elements that explain how Robin Hood came into existence, are reduced to a few shots and proclamations. The end of the film tells it all: it reminds us that we were supposed to see the story of how the legend of Robin Hood started. The makers just forgot to tell it.\n\n\nDirector: Ridley Scott\nRelease Date:  May 2010\nGenre: Action | Drama\nCountry: USA | UK \nLanguage: English \nColor: Color \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36cd2ac16a4259301c679d2d62e08035a9bcf80f","amp;dn":"Robin+Hood+%28Movie+Trailer%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36cd2ac16a4259301c679d2d62e08035a9bcf80f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,205,42,193,106,66,89,48,28,103,157,45,98,224,128,53,169,188,248,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
