These flightless black and white birds, once called &quot;feathered fish&quot; by some, are called penguins. There are seventeen different kinds of penguins in the world. Your student can learn about these fascinating animals with the 139-page Penguins Project Pack from In the Hands of a Child. This pack includes a 28-page Research Guide and 20 hands-on activities to help your student complete a penguin lapbook about physical characteristics, anatomy, habitat, diet, life cycle, conservation, and the different species (please note: the section on penguin species and 5 corresponding hands-on activities are geared toward older students).\n\nGrade Level: K-8th\n\nPages: 139\n\nHOAC Lapbook 1123 this was renumber from SM1003\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a789a2e04f8b122a2417c191b018ecb9ecba37ce","amp;dn":"Penguins+Lapbook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a789a2e04f8b122a2417c191b018ecb9ecba37ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,137,162,224,79,139,18,42,36,23,193,145,176,24,236,185,236,186,55,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
