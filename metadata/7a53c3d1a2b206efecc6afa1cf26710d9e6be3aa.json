Three\nmen, Michael Codnor, Eric Williams and Oliver Philpot made\nit back to Britain via the Baltic and Sweden after escaping\nfrom Stalag Luft III.\n\nStalag Luft III was designed to be escape proof. Forty\nor more tunnels were discovered under construction\nbefore this one succeeded.\n\nThe tunnel's start point was concealed at a position in view\nof the camp guards. It was opened only when a vaulting\nhorse was placed over it. The vaulting horse was carried to\nand from the concealed worksite each day. Inside the horse\nwere the tunnelers, and, after a day's work, tunnel cuttings.\n\nWhile they dug, other PoWs used the vaulting horse for its\noriginal purpose - physical exercise. \n\nThe production captures a feeling of paranoia and alienation.\nIt's less good on some of the characters, who are played with\na touch too much English sang froid [old chap].\n\nOn the whole though, it's well worth the listen.\n\nCast\nAlex Jennings\nDavid Lumsden\nKeith Drinkel\nDavid Holt\nBrett Usher \nWilliam Brand\nPeter Gunn\nLloyd Johnston\nJohn Church\nJohn Webb\nTimothy Carlton\nCyrial Jenkins\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.culture24.org.uk/history+%26+heritage/war+%26+conflict/world+war+two/art29411&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.culture24.org.uk/history+%26+heritage/war+%26+conflict/world+war+two/art29411&lt;/a&gt;\n.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a53c3d1a2b206efecc6afa1cf26710d9e6be3aa","amp;dn":"BBC+R4+-+Eric+Williams%5C%27+%5C%27The+Wooden+Horse%5C%27+sp7","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a53c3d1a2b206efecc6afa1cf26710d9e6be3aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,83,195,209,162,178,6,239,236,198,175,161,207,38,113,13,158,107,227,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
