I will make a rar file and name them with &quot;Husbehov Edit #X&quot; (X=The higher number, the latest version) so that you who already downloaded an earlier version of my Husbehov will be able to know which torrent you will download next time.\n\nAll songs are 320 kbps but I use Audacity to cut songs where I think they should start. That's why in the description it says 128 kbps. The quality doesn't get worse, it only says so in the description.\n\n\n\nThis edit contains following HOT tracks:\nAdam K - My Love (Original Mix) (Feat. King Sunshine)\nAudiosoul - Lights On (Mikael Weermets &amp; Audible Remix) (Feat.
