But Oona O'Leary faces the rare dilemma of a blank TiMER. Her soul mate - whoever and wherever he is - has yet to have a TiMER implanted. Staring down the barrel of thirty and tired of waiting for her would-be life partner to get off the dime, Oona breaks her own rules and falls for Mikey, a charming and inappropriately young supermarket clerk with a countdown of four months.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7231363650153366d9997598153205720efc2db","amp;dn":"Timer.2009.DVDRip.XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7231363650153366d9997598153205720efc2db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,35,19,99,101,1,83,54,109,153,151,89,129,83,32,87,32,239,194,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
