Basically, it's about a kid who is raised from early childhood to be a heartless ninja assassin, but there finally comes a time when he just can't be a heartless killer any longer.  One small oddity of the film is that it stars 'Rain', a Korean Pop-music star who has NO martial arts training, yet you wouldn't know this from watching the film as the martial arts and acrobatics are quite spectacular.\n \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTrivia\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1.  Korean Pop Star 'Rain' who stars in the film had NO martial arts training prior to signing on to do this film.  He underwent a short training camp prior to filming, but that and the direction of choreographers, 'Rain' was a 'martial arts virgin'.\n2.  After Raizo - played by Rain - is first captured and chained to the wall, one of his captors looks at him through the camera monitoring him and says, &quot;He looks like he should be in a boy band.&quot;  Rain started his career in the boy band Fanclub before becoming a superstar solo artist whose initial popularity in Asia has spread to other continents. \n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nScreenshots\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/ninja1.jpg\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/ninja2.jpg\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/ninja3.jpg\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/ninja4.jpg\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/ninja5.jpg\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/ninja6.jpg\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/ninja7.jpg\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/ninja8.jpg\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAdditional Info\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLike all my iPod torrents, these files have their ID3 tags preformatted for your ease!
