Strangers (live) [3:46]\n\n&quot;Acorns&quot; by Elia Goat and the Natural Horns is a jazzy Americana album.\n\nMany of the songs play along on a rootsy note, with an acoustic guitar, folk picking, and a lead vocal, sometimes the production even featuring an amazing upright bass. The bass especially plays a huge role in the track &quot;Shelter in the Ground&quot;, adding a solid bed for the vocals that are slightly dipped in reverb, a perfect mix all around.\n\nThe track &quot;Pacific Coast&quot; starts off with high harmonics playing off the bass, and then kicks into purposefully loose multi-vocals, suddenly, around the chorus they take a turn into noise experimentation, with the vocal suddenly morphing into an echo drenched in verb and delay, taking things into a whole other realm. This trick is repeated throughout the song, and adds more dynamic to an already very dynamic album.\n\nThe album is never boring, while some arrangements are acoustic, other of course feature horns, and take things into a more jazzy territory. Also the entire album is split down the middle, half being studio recorded, and half being a live performance.\n\nAltogether Acorns is a very fun, interesting, and rewarding listen.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04e733bd6eef7f630a0a5363186caedd72d54f14","amp;dn":"Elia+Goat+and+the+Natural+Horns+-+Acorns+%5B2012%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04e733bd6eef7f630a0a5363186caedd72d54f14","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,231,51,189,110,239,127,99,10,10,83,99,24,108,174,221,114,213,79,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
