WRONG!!! Even if 2HD has right about some stuff, they haven't been able to even adjust proper audio level on all their encodings for last YEAR. So, they sound pissed by meddling of other Scene-groups, but - hey! - do not want to be judged by same measure.\nPLEASE, consult TV.COM. It IS EPISODE 13. Last week were aired TWO EPISODES - eleventh and twelfth.
