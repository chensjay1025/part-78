The group's goal was to &quot;bring the (Vietnam) War home&quot; through acts of militant tactics.\n\nReally good movie about a radical group trying to enact change in the government threw any means necessary.  They never killed anyone that im aware of.  I think some of them blew them selves up by accident.  If you liked V for vendetta its that kind of craziness only real people.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e35f07902b118223362d05c0f24dbab2c35256d","amp;dn":"Weather.underground-xvid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e35f07902b118223362d05c0f24dbab2c35256d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,53,240,121,2,177,24,34,51,98,208,92,15,36,219,171,44,53,37,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
