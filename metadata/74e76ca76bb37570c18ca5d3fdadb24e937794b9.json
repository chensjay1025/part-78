(1981) Walter Mathau. \n\nAt the start of the story, the death of Associate Justice Stanley Moorehead has created a vacancy on the United States Supreme Court. The new appointee turns out to be Ruth Loomis, a staunch conservative, who is confirmed as the first female US Supreme Court Justice. She and Associate Justice Daniel Snow, a committed liberal (nowadays the term would be ultra-conservative) and many years older than Loomis, clash intellectually on just about every judicial issue before them. One case involves a pornographic film and arguments about freedom of speech. With time, the two characters develop a liking and respect for each other.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74e76ca76bb37570c18ca5d3fdadb24e937794b9","amp;dn":"First+Monday+in+October","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74e76ca76bb37570c18ca5d3fdadb24e937794b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,231,108,167,107,179,117,112,193,140,165,211,253,173,178,78,147,119,148,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
