The spiritual concept and foundation of DomgÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥rd is based upon the anti-cosmic philosophy and the ascending Chaosofical cult of Ginn. Our ritual creations are nothing but audible sparks of Surts fire and dissolving vibrations of the ancient Dragon's breath.\n\nThe night of 30 october 1997 the seed was sown which soon grew to become DomgÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥rd, when Vindkall and Trollheim met through a mutual friend at an traditional arrangemant. After a longer discussion, which elucidated that they had similar visions, they decided to start a band together. Trollheim introduced his friend Orm to Vindkall and during the following dark winter months the three spent a lot of time in Orms basement which was decorated as a rehearsal room. Some tracks were recorded on tape but it circulated only among closer acquaintances.\n\nIn the surroundings of the place lied a desolated mountain called Domberget, and which also partly inspired to the name DomgÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥rd, and the company spent several inspiring nights there under the moon and stars. Something was born and many thoughts and ideas were developed. 1998 Ulv was connected to the musical host. The members were also active in other musical projects but gradually they all focused more of their energy on DomgÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥rd. After a time of rehearsing DomgÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥rd was resting but in the beginning of 1999 when the band got a new rehearsal place, including several rooms and which also became an alternative home for the members, a new active period begun. New material was written and rehearsal demos was recorded. Due to lack of time Trollheim left the band and after a time Vindkall introduced his recent friend Illbrand to DomgÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥rd and he became the new singer. A creative and enthusiastic period followed.\n\nDomgÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥rd had since a time begun a darker chapter and some new course of events took place when some of the members gave full expression to violent visions of blood and flames. The foundation of DomgÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥rd wasn't only music and the ideas of an occult brotherhood of terror, whose essence should be reflected in the music, were realized. After an intense period the members of DomgÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥rd were arrested for several actions. Some months later a trial was processed against the members. Vindkall and Illbrand were judged to five years in prison while Orm was judged to two and a half years. DomgÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥rd was resting again, but grew at the same stronger and when Vindkall got access to a guitar in prison new musical creations were born. DomgÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥rd got a lot of attention in the media and several books were written which emphasized the band. Yet few people had have the possibility to hear their music even if some persons began to spread one of the bands older rehearsal demos.\n\nFinally came the day when the members were released from prison, but DomgÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥rd continued as a duo that consisted of Vindkall and Ulv whom recorded the demo Blodskald in the summer of 2004. Orm wasn't a part of DomgÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥rd since the year 2000 and Illbrand had lost interest in playing music, even if he at some time discussed about working with DomgÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥rd again. But he chose to leave this physical world behind and hanged himself in July 2007, leaving a notification which proclaimed that this life wasn't rewarding enough for him and that he should search for his goal in the unknown beyond.\n\nThere have been a lot of circumstances around which have restrained the band from presenting their creations, and during the following three years DomgÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥rd proceeded with only Vindkall holding the banner. But in autumn 2008 Hrimner and MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¸rkestÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¸l joined the horde and in the end of the year Hraegelmir, from the band Panphage, became a part of the assemblage. During the spring of 2009 MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¸rkestÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¸l had to take the decision to leave the band, for this time at least, due to lack of time.\n\nIn March and April 2009 the trio of DomgÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥rd entered Studio Decay in Gothenburg to record Svartsejd, which is their part of a split together with Cursed 13, and it was later mastered in Necromorbus Studio. The split will be released December 21st 2009.\n\nVindkall and Heljarmadr from Cursed 13 also came to the agreement to join each others bands for the possibility to perform live rituals. So from the summer DomgÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥rd consists of four warriors and the horde is now more focused and durable than ever. At the eleventh year of DomgÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥rd a new triumphant chapter began...\n\nCurrent line-up\nVindkall - Vocals, Guitar, Synth (Nox Aurea, Cursed 13)\nHeljarmadr - Guitar (Cursed 666/Cursed 13, Diabolic Lust) (2009 - )\nHraegelmir - Bass, Vocals (Panzerkampf, Panphage, Dientalpia)\nHrimner - Drums\n\nGenre = Black Metal\nFormat = mp3\nBit Rate = 320 kbps\n\nTrack Listing\n1.
