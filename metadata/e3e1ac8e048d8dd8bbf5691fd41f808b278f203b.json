Montoliu digs into eight familiar standards (including &quot;You Go to My Head,&quot; &quot;'Round Midnight,&quot; &quot;A Child Is Born&quot; and &quot;Giant Steps&quot;) and to his credit comes up with fresh new variations. Montoliu's style has Bud Powell's bop approach as its foundation but also incorporates the more modern chord voicings of McCoy Tyner and Bill Evans. This album is a fine example of his talents. (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01 - You Go To My Head\n02 - When I Fall In Love\n03 - 'Round About Midnight\n04 - A Child Is Born\n05 - Giant Steps\n06 - Imagination\n07 - That`s All\n08 - Solar\n\nEnjoy and share!
