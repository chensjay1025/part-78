More an FPS adventure game than anything. If you dig underwater photography, looking for artifacts, sand, water, cameras, stuff, stuff, and water... you should TRY THIS GAME NOW!!! (just install and play)\n--------------------------------------\n\nDescription:\nImagine yourself as an uncanny mercenary. Yes, you shoot, but rather pictures, not people. And now imagine that you were sent into the middle of Mezoamerican nowhere by a rather annoying hyperactive biologist friend of yours who's main goal is to have some decent photos of the fish you've never heard of. Seems like a couple of another well-paid days, fortunately without any newlyweds. And it is Ã¢â‚¬â€œ until you find out that someone was there before you. Much before Ã¢â‚¬â€œ about 500 years. Therefore this shooting amidst the reefs becomes an inquiry in order to find out what happened there. Welcome to Reef Shot Ã¢â‚¬â€œ an unconventional underwater adventure game set along the coast of Robinson Crusoe Island. \n\nWhat is Reef Shot? \nIn this game you play as Scott, a freelance photographer hired by Renee Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a biologist who's going to examine the fish species living near the Robinson Crusoe island near the southeastern coasts of South America. At the beginning your goal is to take as good photos of those fish as you can. But while diving you will encounter also various relics of the ancient Mayan culture which will lead you to the mysterious El Dorado. As the game goes on, you will use more advanced cameras which will test your focus and agility skills. Thanks to the sandbox model you can swim wherever you want and see the breathtaking underwater fauna and flora of an underwater world. \n\nWhat makes Reef Shot special? \n-genre: FPA Ã¢â‚¬â€œ first person adventure game \n-involving storyline based on the legend of El Dorado and the history of famous, mad conquistador Lope de Aguirre\n-engaging and challenging tasks: search for artifacts to discover the mystery and find new fish species \n-easy to follow navigation system leading you through the plot and bonus tasks \n-real and diversified fish species, Mayan glyphs and artifacts \n-system of supportive perks \n-immersive and high quality soundtrack \n-full English and German versions \n-Game Pad supported (Xbox 360 type)\n\n\nMinimum Requirements:\nOperating System: Microsoft Windows: XP SP3, Vista, 7 \nProcessor: Intel Pentium 4 2.4 GHz, AMD Athlon 64 2800+, Intel Core 2 1.8 GHz or equivalent \nMemory: 2 GB \nHard Disk Space: 560 MB \nVideo: NVIDIA GeForce 6800 or higher, ATI x850 or higher \nSound: An OpenAL compatible sound card\n\n\n--------------------------------------\n*Absolutely 100% clean and working!*\n*My upload ain't the best, but I'll seed this forever!*\n*BUY the games you reallllly dig!!!*","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c861f011aef05c41ae4004c686abf4b5dd8a9de","amp;dn":"Reefshot+1.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c861f011aef05c41ae4004c686abf4b5dd8a9de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,134,31,1,26,239,5,196,26,228,0,76,104,106,191,75,93,216,169,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
