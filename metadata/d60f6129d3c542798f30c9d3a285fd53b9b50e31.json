The monthly magazine was launched in October 1980 by Time Inc. Discover was originally launched into a burgeoning market for science magazines aimed at educated non-professionals, intended to be somewhat easier to read than Scientific American but more detailed and science-oriented than magazines like Popular Science. Discover was left largely alone in its market space by the mid-1980s, but nevertheless decided to appeal to a wider audience, including more articles on psychology and psychiatry.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d60f6129d3c542798f30c9d3a285fd53b9b50e31","amp;dn":"Discover+Magazine+-+July+%26+August+2010+%28Malestrom%29.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d60f6129d3c542798f30c9d3a285fd53b9b50e31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,15,97,41,211,197,66,121,143,48,201,211,162,133,253,83,185,181,14,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
