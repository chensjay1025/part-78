The Prince has returned home to Babylon, to find himself hunted by a supernatural creature bent on his destruction. Forced to live a life on the run, he seeks counsel from an old mystic, who explains that his actions have spawned an immortal incarnation of Fate, known as the Dahaka. In his quest to save the Sultan's palace from destruction, the Prince created a rift in the Timeline.\n\nHunted by the Dahaka, the Prince embarks upon a path of both carnage and mystery to defy his preordained death, as he quickly comes to realize that there's only one possible way to stay alive: journey to the birthplace of the Sands of Time, find a way to travel back into the past, and stop the Sands from being created. Without the Sands, the Prince's last adventure will not occur and the Dahaka will vanish. His journey leads him to the infernal core of a cursed island stronghold harboring mankind's greatest fears. \n\n\nMinimum Configuration:\n\nWin 98 SE/2000/XP Only\n\nDirectX 9.0c\n\n1000 MHz Pentium III, AMD Athlon or equivalent\n\n256 MB RAM NVIDIA GeForce 3 or higher,\n\nATI Radeon 7500 or higher,\n\nIntel 915G DirectX 8.0 compatible sound device\n\n1.5 GB hard drive space for minimum installation Windows-compatible\nmouse required\n\n\nInstallation Note:\n1 - Unzip\n2 - Run &quot;Unpak.bat&quot; to unpack dataz.\n3 - Run &quot;PrinceOfPersia.exe&quot; first to detect hardware.\n4 - play with &quot;PrinceOfPersia.exe&quot; or &quot;POP2.EXE&quot;. \n\n\nPLEASE SEED AFTER YOUR DONE","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41a418705893fc01bd45a2a98e8dbf7fca0b977b","amp;dn":"Pince+Of+Persia%3AWarrior+Within+%5B290MB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41a418705893fc01bd45a2a98e8dbf7fca0b977b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,164,24,112,88,147,252,1,189,69,162,169,142,141,191,127,202,11,151,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
