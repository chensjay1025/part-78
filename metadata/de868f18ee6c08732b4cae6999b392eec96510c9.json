Live albums make or break bands! And for this live album Over Kill definetly makes! Why is Over Kill one of the most popular bands to play live? This album is why. The sound quality on this album is excellent! Almost as good as a studio album! The musicianship is just excellent; no instrument over powers another. The riffs up to the drum beats are copied as if they came right off the real albums. Another reason why this live album kicks ass! Let me explain a bit: to many times have I seen bands come out with live albums and or compilations, only to throw all their new songs on them, rejecting the past stuff. This album does not do that at all. In fact Over Kill manages to take something from Bloodletting (there newest album) and something from their debut (Feel the Fire). This is awsome for two types of fans! This is great for the old fans because they get Over Kill blasting the new stuff and the old classics. This is also great for new fans becuase not only do they get the new stuff, but they get a feel for Over Kill's 80 years, which might lead them to listen and purchase all there other stuff. One more great thing about this album is the word &quot;fuck&quot;. I started counting but lost count after 20. Blitz says fuck so many fucking times it is fucking unbelievable! Fuck I can't even say fuck that many fucking times without fucking up. FUCK! In conclusion, you won't be dissapointed with this album! It is a must for all metal heads!!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de868f18ee6c08732b4cae6999b392eec96510c9","amp;dn":"Overkill+-+Wrecking+Everything+LIVE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de868f18ee6c08732b4cae6999b392eec96510c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,134,143,24,238,108,8,115,43,76,174,105,153,179,146,238,201,101,16,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
