She was loaded deep with a shifting, noisy cargo that lifted white noses and huddled broad, woolly backs in fact, nothing less extraordinary than fifteen fat Southdown sheep and a sober-faced collie-dog. The crew of this remarkable craft consisted of a sinewy, bearded man of forty-five who minded sheet and tiller in the stern, and a boy of fourteen, tall and broad for his age, who was constantly employed in soothing and restraining the bleating flock. No one was present to witness the spectacle because, in those remote days, there were scarcely a thousand white men on the whole coast of Maine from Elttery to Louisberg, while at this season of the year the Indians were following the migrating game along the northern rivers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e53537eff652ec900f3fbd5f61d0c4ce253e65e8","amp;dn":"The+Black+Buccaneer+by+Stephen+W.+Meader","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e53537eff652ec900f3fbd5f61d0c4ce253e65e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,53,55,239,246,82,236,144,15,63,189,95,97,208,196,206,37,62,101,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
