These Giants were specially trained under the influence of\nhardcore organics which were known to heal and make them strong,usually the life span of\na giant was around 400 years so they kept taking rebirths until and unless they fulfill\nthere duty and there duty was to defeat evil without any regrets whatsoever and if they\nfail to do so they would have to take a rebirth and shall continue there job,once the job\nis done giants would return back to paradise forever and only then mankind would exist. \n\nThe main aim of these giants was to destroy evil and live like a free soul away from the\nmaterialistic world and just to be a free soul the karma of destroying evil was the key\n!!! \n\nA life without a birth,a soul without a body !!! \n\nThis Album takes us through the training procedures and rigorous processes explaing how\ngood prevailed over evil and the exact story beign demonstrated through sound when heard\nin higher state of conciousness would explain the entire epic in detail that caused an\nEvil Stampede, so be prepared for an excruciating yet ultimately power packed dark\npsychedelic mystical journey into the deep realms of mind to attain next level of\nawareness and Let the music do the talking !!!! \n\n\nAlbum: Stampede \nLabel: Biomechanix Records \nCatalogue: BMCD005 \nMastering by: Tryambaka at Big Bellies Studios @ Portugal \nFormat: CD Jewel case \nCover art by: Brita/Mumbai India And Piule @ Piule studios Mxico DF \nPromotional video by: Vj Piule \nRelease Date: 5th feb 2010\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n\n01.
