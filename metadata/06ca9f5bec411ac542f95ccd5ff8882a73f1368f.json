Many thanks to all :)\nNow the anton studio video is one of the best cams we've seen for a while, but had a few small issues and just over 3mins of video missing, hence the reason for using to other sources so we can bring to you a FULL version ;-)\nWork done....well firstly we had to check the anton video to see where the footage was missing and most was at the very begining but there was two other spots.....one 3/4 into the video and one near the very end.\nOnce we found them all we had to cut them out of the other release and then resize to match the res of our main encode.....so AR might be slightly off in parts, but not by much at all.\nThe main bulk of the video just needed a few tweaks here and there...mainly a change in the rgb colours, contrast, brightness and chroma.\nAlso there was some camera movement so we had to crop differently throughout the film and then resize them all to match.\nThen onto the audio......well that was just off one video which had the full movie so it was a case of stripping it, filtering it and then syncing....\nThink we did a pretty decent job on the sync, considering it ain't easy syncing to talking dogs so :P\n\nAnyway the rating of this film is crap ...lowest we've seen :lol: but i'm sure the kids will love it so .......enjoy :)\n\ncredit IMAGiNE &amp; the_net BIG BIG BIG TIME &amp; to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)\n\n*****help what we can with others in need...the world is ONE big family*****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06ca9f5bec411ac542f95ccd5ff8882a73f1368f","amp;dn":"Marmaduke+CAM+XViD+V2+-+IMAGiNE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06ca9f5bec411ac542f95ccd5ff8882a73f1368f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,202,159,91,236,65,26,197,66,249,92,205,95,248,136,42,115,241,54,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
