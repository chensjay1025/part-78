Corso and William Burnes regarding a position Col. Corso held involving overseeing the research and reproduction of alien technology recovered from Roswell and other sites.\n\nCorso also talks about a moon base, in fact if you listen he says there is a photo of it in a moon lander pic, however Linda and William seem to cover up this comment. It may have been indeed a mistake, but it sounded fishy to me as Corso stated it very clearly.\n\nThanks Saint&amp;Sinner for the original audio\n\nPlease rate and comment as you feel appropriate, and if you enjoy the content please seed so others may as well/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:082d050af6a4b6fc1c1fd2eea489e703f1614eb0","amp;dn":"C2CAM+07-06-1997+-+Col.+Philip+Corso+On+Roswell+And+Replicating+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"082d050af6a4b6fc1c1fd2eea489e703f1614eb0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,45,5,10,246,164,182,252,28,31,210,238,164,137,231,3,241,97,78,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
