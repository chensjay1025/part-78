At the same time, however, these recordings are documents of a type of music that may not survive for many more years in this cultural setting. The youngest artists on this disc are now in theit fifties, and they are the youngest practitioners of this art in the mid-south region who learned their music in the traditional manner. Most such artists are in their sixties, seventies, and eighties. Younger ones are learning the tradition. The artists on this disc represent about one-third of the total number of blues artists who are known to be currently performing in the area of Mississippi, West Tennessee, and East Arkansas in a solo or duo style. They chosen for presentation here because they are among the artist least represented on recordings previously. A single listen, however, will show that they are deserving of greater fame and that they are among the artistic leaders in the country blues of the 1990's. All of these recordings were made in the first week of 1994 in Memphis and northern Mississippi in informal settings and improvised home 'studios'. One-quarter of the selections are spirituals. \nThese illustrate the fact that most of these artists are more than simply 'bluesmen' and that the blues and spiritual traditions have much in common in their musical styles...' by Dr. David Evans\n\n1.
