(Spanish for &quot;Alarm!&quot; is a Mexican news-magazine that specializes in graphic pictures of traffic accidents, murder victims, etc., as well as pictures of scantily clad women. The magazine was first published on April 17, 1963, and its success has spawned several competitors (including Alarde!, Enlace! and PoliÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ster). It was censored briefly between 1986 and 1991, during which time it was not published, before returning as El nuevo Alarma! The magazine states it has a circulation of 15 million copies.\n\nIncluded are a couple issues of Alarma to go with the docu.\n\nTo view the .cbr files they're in you'll need to either use a comic book archive reader (I recommend CoView), or just open the file in whatever archive program you use (a cbr is just a renamed rar) and extract the JPGs in there to wherever you want.\n\n\nThe docu is in Spanish with English hardsubs.\n\nfilename:       Alarma.2008.Part.1.WebRip.XviD\nfilesize:       181,953,748\nvideo codec:    XviD 1.1.2 Final\nvideo bitrate:  1345kbps\nbits per pixel: 0.204\nduration:       16:06.308\nresolution:     624*352\nfps:            29.970\nframe count:    28960\naudio codec:    0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\naudio bitrate:  160kbps CBR\naudio channels: 2\naudio tracks:   1 [1-Main Movie]\n\n\nfilename:       Alarma.2008.Part.2.WebRip.XviD\nfilesize:       199,022,266\nvideo codec:    XviD 1.1.2 Final\nvideo bitrate:  1274kbps\nbits per pixel: 0.194\nduration:       18:29.453\nresolution:     624*352\nfps:            29.970\nframe count:    33250\naudio codec:    0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\naudio bitrate:  160kbps CBR\naudio channels: 2\naudio tracks:   1 [1-Main Movie]\n\nfilename:       Alarma.2008.Part.3.WebRip.XviD\nfilesize:       189,402,190\nvideo codec:    XviD 1.1.2 Final\nvideo bitrate:  1173kbps\nbits per pixel: 0.178\nduration:       18:55.846\nresolution:     624*352\nfps:            29.970\nframe count:    34041\naudio codec:    0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\naudio bitrate:  160kbps CBR\naudio channels: 2\naudio tracks:   1 [1-Main Movie]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea95c561b7553c0e7c0b9538d3302b9b4330b8a5","amp;dn":"Alarma-Mexican.Scenes.Of.Death.WEBRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea95c561b7553c0e7c0b9538d3302b9b4330b8a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,149,197,97,183,85,60,14,124,11,149,56,211,48,43,155,67,48,184,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
