Howard. A 17th century Puritan, Solomon Kane is a somber-looking man who wanders the world with no apparent goal other than to vanquish evil in all its forms. His adventures, published mostly in the pulp magazine Weird Tales, often take him from Europe to the jungles of Africa and back.\n\nEnjoy\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef26ee6db6a3e26cee646456e989a95d053800bc","amp;dn":"Solomon.Kane.DVDScr.XVID-JinX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef26ee6db6a3e26cee646456e989a95d053800bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,38,238,109,182,163,226,108,238,100,100,86,233,137,169,93,5,56,0,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
