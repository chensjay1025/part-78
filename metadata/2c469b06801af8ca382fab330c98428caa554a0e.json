They have been around for quite some time and are well respected in the metal community. These releases are very hard to find in FLAC and so I decided to put them together and upload them under a single torrent. Please note, none of these rips are mine.\n\nThis torrent contains lossless rips of more or less all their full lengths. Rips of Imagery (1996) and Passage into Forlorn (2001) are not available since the CDs are incredibly hard to find. However, there is a rip of the reissue under the compilation &quot;Imagery + Passage into Forlorn&quot;. Also, the In Silence and Virtuosity Demos aren't included since they're nowhere to be found either. If I manage to get a hold of Live Progression, I'll add it.\n\nI do not support stealing a band's music without giving them credit and money. Underground bands need our support so we need to purchase the albums and merchandise of bands we like or even attend their concerts.\n\nSo please, go to Galy Records or Willowtip or Prosthetic records and ask them for these albums. They mostly sell for around $10 to $15, which is fairly cheap.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c469b06801af8ca382fab330c98428caa554a0e","amp;dn":"Neuraxis+Discography+FLAC+%28Technical+Melodic+Death+Metal%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c469b06801af8ca382fab330c98428caa554a0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,70,155,6,128,26,248,202,56,47,171,51,12,152,66,140,170,85,74,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
