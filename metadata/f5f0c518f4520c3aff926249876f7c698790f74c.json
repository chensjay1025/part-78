You are only able to watch the replays of your games vs the AI if you have loaded the correct AI-Script. Meaning if you want to watch a replay from a match between you and a 6.1 AI you have to select the 6.1 AI script, start a game, exit the game and then select the replay you wish to watch. So if you update to a newer version of the A.I-script and want to watch an old replay you HAVE to load the old A.I-script first.  \nAfter new patch is released replays won't work untill you download the latest cache file\nLink [url]http://www.sc2win.com/starcraft-2-downloads/starcraft-2-cache-files-update/[/url]\n\n7)Difficulty can be changed using laucher itself but some times it won't change so you need to do it manually ke you did in previous step\nP.S I recommend you to play strategy 0.22 ai as it will truely test your skills\n\n8)Enjoy playing starcraft 2 aand if you wanna watch some starcraft 2 videos with commentary I recommend to subscribe to the following channels\nfavourite)\n\nP.S Whenever you change AI using launcher make sure to\n    Restart the launcher after saving the AI and then select the map \n    otherwise the game will grant you instant victory on loading\n    Also if you want to watch replays select original AI from AI folder using launcher -&gt;save -&gt;restart launcher and then select the replay\n\n :D  :D [color=Red]Don't forget to say thanks[/color] :D  :D \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5f0c518f4520c3aff926249876f7c698790f74c","amp;dn":"Starcraft+2+Beta+Launcher+Pack+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5f0c518f4520c3aff926249876f7c698790f74c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,240,197,24,244,82,12,58,255,146,98,73,135,111,124,105,135,144,247,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
