A group called Direct Action claims responsibility.\n\nOctober 14th, 1982: a truck explodes outside the Litton Industries plant in Rexdale, Ontario, where guidance systems for the cruise missle were manufactured, resulting in millions of dollars in damages. Direct Action again claims responsibility.\n\nNovember 22nd, 1982: three locations of Red Hot Video - a store specializing in violent bootleg pornography - were firebombed.  A group calling themselves Wimmin's Fire Brigade claims responsibility.\n\nAnn Hansen, along with four others, who became to be known as the Squamish 5, eventually stood trial for these acts and were sentenced to life in prison.  She served seven years.\n\nRecorded in October 2002, Ann Hansen reflects on the successes and failures of the bombings, and dispels some of the common myths surrounding not only her actions, but armed struggle in general.  She also explores the differences between direct action and terrorisim as means of affecting social change; laying the groundwork for defining what direct action means, what its guiding principles are, and how it can be applied successfully and meaningfully in today's political climate.\n\nMade in Canada\nUPC: 777215104709\nG7 Welcoming Committee Records &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.g7welcomingcommittee.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.g7welcomingcommittee.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf you like this work you'd best think of buying it...they're violent you know. :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4031b730475d4b35b1700a22286ff5c2f22c0afa","amp;dn":"Anne+Hansen+-+Direct+Action+%28Reflections+no+Armed+Resistance+and","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4031b730475d4b35b1700a22286ff5c2f22c0afa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,49,183,48,71,93,75,53,177,112,10,34,40,111,245,194,242,44,10,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
