This is   \n    the story of three maps, three 'visions' of London over   \n    three centuries; visions of beauty that celebrate but      \n    also distort the truth. It's the story of how urban       \n    maps try to impose order on chaos.                       \n                                                              \n    On Sunday 2 September 1660, the Great Fire of London       \n    began reducing most of the city to ashes, and among the   \n    huge losses were many maps of the city itself. The       \n    Morgan Map of 1682 was the first to show the whole of     \n    the City of London after the fire. Consisting of           \n    sixteen separate sheets, measuring eight feet by five     \n    feet, it took six years to complete. Morgan's beautiful  \n    map symbolised the hoped-for ideal city.                  \n                                                               \n    In 1746 John Rocque produced at the time the most         \n    detailed map ever made of London. Like Morgan's,         \n    Rocque's map is all neo-Classical beauty and clinical     \n    precision, but the London it represented had become the    \n    opposite. In engravings of the time, such as Night, the   \n    artist William Hogarth shows a city boiling with vice    \n    and corruption. Stephen Walter's contemporary image,      \n    The Island, plays with notions of cartographic order       \n    and respectability. His extraordinary London map looks    \n    at first glance to be just as precise and ordered as     \n    his hero Rocque's but, looking closer, it includes 21st   \n    century markings such as 'favourite kebab vans' and        \n    sites of 'personal heartbreak'.                           \n                                                              \n      \n\n      \n            .  . ..: RiPPER/RELEASE NOTES :.. .  .           \n                                                              \n                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                             \n                                                              \n                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                             \n      \n\n                                             \n                  ..: GROUP NEWS/CONTACT :..  \n                                                           \n                                                      \n       SFM is dedicated to bringing you high quality     \n      TVRips and DVDRips of popular series and movies for   \n                     your viewing pleasure!                 \n                                                           \n       We are currently looking for:                       \n       - 100+ Mbit EU dump site for exclusive SFM usage   \n       - HDTV/PDTV cappers                                \n       - Crates &amp; Kegs of Beer (full of course)          \n                                                         \n                  .  . ..: GREETZ :.. .  .","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13f64d7d08de4891067b0c1e37320f4286b98d45","amp;dn":"The.Beauty.of.Maps.S01E02.720p.HDTV.x264-SFM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13f64d7d08de4891067b0c1e37320f4286b98d45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,246,77,125,8,222,72,145,6,123,12,30,55,50,15,66,134,185,141,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
