Joey lives with Carl, his roommate, a bit of a sex maniac with a thing for younger women.\n\nJoey and Carl basically screw their way through a post WW2 Paris and indulge in a whole lot of wanton sex with pretty much any woman willing, alone or in groups, or whatever, they don't really seem to care.\n\nCharged with obscenity in May of 1970 though cleared shortly after in Federal Court, Quiet Days In Clichy has been suspiciously absent of any legitimate release since then.\n\nMost of the indoors scenes where filmed in Copenhagen, including the jazz club with Ben Webster and the anti-semitic cafe scene.\n\n&quot;...it was a period when cunt was in the air.&quot;\n(This is the official theme of the movie, I didn't make it up.)\n\nWorth mentioning: the soundtrack is by (former hippy) Country Joe McDonald of Country Joe &amp; the Fish fame (his only film soundtrack) the theme song is quite a catchy tune.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbf2177241f2a569c6e97b18a72248e5747c1a93","amp;dn":"Quiet.Days.In.Clichy.DVDRip.1970+%28Euro-Sleaze%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbf2177241f2a569c6e97b18a72248e5747c1a93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,242,23,114,65,242,165,105,198,233,123,24,167,34,72,229,116,124,26,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
