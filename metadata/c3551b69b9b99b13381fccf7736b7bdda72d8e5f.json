This project, which initially has been set up by a member of Rajna (cf. GÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½rard Chambellant) remains very close to the mystic ambiances of this other great French combo. ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½SomniaÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ for sure reinforce the link with Rajna and I even dare to say that after the newest Rajna-album (cf. ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Hidden templeÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½), both bands can be simply confused with each other. Just like for the Rajna writing process, AmÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½GaneshaÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s uses an impressive number of traditional instruments while female chants reinforced the tribal moods by enigmatic chants and lamentations. The main difference with Rajna, is that they here also inject male chants and still covers other cultural influences like Gregorian inspiration. ThereÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s a symbiosis between female and male vocals, which brings some diversity in the Eastern soundscapes. The only regret is that several songs are too short and that was already an aspect that I noticed on the debut album. The use of multiple and typical Eastern instruments reinforce the esoteric feeling and the unique sound of the project. Just like Rajna, they remind to the splendor of Dead Can Dance, but are definitely more authentic. The tracklist contains different great pieces like ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Lumen mentisÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½, ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ProcellaÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½, the definitely Rajna sounding ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½CanticumÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½, ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Mesmerized mirrorÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½, ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ChimeraÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ that contains an impressive vocal performance and ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½EpitaphÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½. Another attention grabber is for sure ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Gloria in excelsisÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½, which features a kind of merging between Gregorian chants and Eastern atmospheres. This is a very compact and coherent release, opening the gates of cultural fascination and sacred rites. This is a heavenly experience you canÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½t miss!\n\nTracklist:\n1 Yidam 1:23\n2 Lumen Mentis 3:22\n3 Gloria In Excelsis 3:34\nKeyboards ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Alain GrandiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨re\n4 Procella 3:39\nDrums, Timpani ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Alain GrandiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨re\n5 The Last Procession 4:08\n6 Canticum 3:43\n7 Litania 3:29\n8 Mesmerized Mirror 2:35\n9 Agni 1:04\n10 Solstice 3:32\nKeyboards ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Alain GrandiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨re\n11 Gashanda 5:06\nKeyboards ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Alain GrandiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨re\n12 Chimera 2:06\n13 Aeternal 3:34\n14 Epitaph 12:41\nDrums, Timpani ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Alain GrandiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨re\n\nCredits:\nArtwork By [Calligraphy] ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ JohnBeguet\nArtwork By [Design, Art Direction] ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©rard Chambellant, Steve VallÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨s, Holy Records\nInstruments [All], Voice, Written-by, Producer ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©rard Chambellant\nMastered By ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Bruno Gruel\nMixed By, Arranged By ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Alain GrandiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨re , GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©rard Chambellant\nVoice, Harmonium [Church] ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Karin MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©rat\n\nNotes:\nRecorded in Kyi Chu Monastery","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3551b69b9b99b13381fccf7736b7bdda72d8e5f","amp;dn":"Am%C3%A2%E2%82%AC%E2%84%A2Ganesha%C3%A2%E2%82%AC%E2%84%A2n+%C3%A2%E2%82%AC%E2%80%9C+Somnia+%282003%29+%5BFLAC%5D+%C3%A2%E2%82%AC%E2%80%9C+insinuendo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3551b69b9b99b13381fccf7736b7bdda72d8e5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,85,27,105,185,185,155,19,56,31,204,247,115,107,123,221,167,45,142,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
