By default it provides three screen-readers, two full-screen magnifiers, global font-size and colour changing facilities as well as support for USB Braille displays. When you boot the live CD you will be greeted by the Orca screen-reader/magnifier which enables you to navigate the graphical Gnome desktop using keybindings, as well as providing full screen-magnification if required.  For those who prefer to work in a simple text based console there is the Speakup screen-reader and as an emergency backup we have installed YASR, a hybrid screen-reader which can be run in either console mode or in a virtual terminal on the Gnome desktop. A second full-screen magnifier is provided by the Compiz Window Manager, which uses 3D technology to allow you to magnify and navigate the whole screen  using the mouse, or move a resizable virtual magnifying glass around the screen. The Gnome  Desktop Manager itself provides you with global keybindings to change the font size and/or the colour scheme on the fly. Finally, Brltty provides Grade 1/2 Braille output via the Orca screen-reader. By default all of the screen-readers use the same Espeak Speech Synthesizer via Speech-Dispatcher which provides a seamless experience for the user when switching from one screen-reader to another!\n\nThe final versions of the USB... of Vinux 3.0 are now available...\n\nmd5sum : 42bd62131ebe493974a9fd962175b305  Vinux-3.0-4GB.img.xz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e9a2f09550b7315bcc9bba9758a290511611dd2","amp;dn":"Vinux-3.0-4GB.img.xz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e9a2f09550b7315bcc9bba9758a290511611dd2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,154,47,9,85,11,115,21,188,201,187,169,117,138,41,5,17,97,29,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
