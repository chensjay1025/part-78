At the end of hour one the new precious metal sponser Damon Gellar (I believe) from Wholesale Direct Metals (http://www. wholesaledirectmetals . com/) makes his first appearance on Deadline. Also during the first hour Jack played a few clips, the one of Ron Paul on Imus stuck out the most to me. You can find the clip here:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.&lt;/a&gt; you tube . com /watch?v=DUk9_GP1gRc\n\nIn the second hour the well known Ray McGovern and Karen Kwiatkowski are on together to give their input on the Israeli raid. Google both to find info on them.\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f69d6b60306317852673424634184e8a670eedbd","amp;dn":"Jack+Blood+2010-06-03+Thu+32k-CF+%28Deadline+LIVE%29+gedude","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f69d6b60306317852673424634184e8a670eedbd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,157,107,96,48,99,23,133,38,115,66,70,52,24,78,138,103,14,237,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
