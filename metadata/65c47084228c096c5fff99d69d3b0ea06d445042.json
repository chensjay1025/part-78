It gained a cult following and is still recognized as one of the best Polish comics.\n\nThe plot resolves around the figure of former military pilot and now space detective, Funky Koval, who with his friends and colleagues forms a private detective agency &quot;Universs&quot; and solves various cases in the futuristic world of 2080s. His investigations range from corruption in the police and government, through fighting cultists and terrorists, investigating missing spaceships and illegal slave camps, to the mystery of the Drolls aliens, who seem to have a much more advanced technology than the humans, and whose plans for the humanity - if any - remain a mystery.\n\nThis version is the result of a joint cooperation between Darkplant-Wisielec-Akela-SWATura-OD.\n\nVolume 3 is hopefully arriving at around October.\n\nWe are hoping to make an exclusive interview with the Polish comic-book legend, Boguslaw Polch. Would you happen to have any questions to him, forward them to me, please, and look out for the answers in Volume 3.\n\nThanxXx,\n\n\nTechnical Specs:\n \nSource: own scanlation\nScanlation Group: Ordo Draconis - Darkplant - SWATura - OD - wisielec - Akela\nComic Book Format: .cbr\nType: coloured\nResolution: 1280x1805\n\nReferences:\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funky_Koval&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funky_Koval&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.lambiek.net/artists/p/polch-boguslaw.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.lambiek.net/artists/p/polch-boguslaw.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\npage samples:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i1272.photobucket.com/albums/y385/swatura2/Funky2074ENG_zps6730d6a4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i1272.photobucket.com/albums/y385/swatura2/Funky2074ENG_zps6730d6a4.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nWE ARE LOOKING FOR PEOPLE WITH A DECENT UNDERSTANDING OF BOTH POLISH AND ENGLISH TO HELP US OUT IN TRANSLATING FURTHER POLISH CLASSIC COMIC BOOKS TO ENGLISH.
