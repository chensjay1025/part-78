He has done considerable scholarship on false flag terror operations.\nHe is the author of \n9-11 Synthetic Terror - Made in USA, \nObama--The Postmodern Coup, \nSurviving The Cataclysm [updated for 2009], \nBarack H. Obama-The Unauthorized Biography \nand co-author of \nThe Unauthorized Biography of George Bush.\n\nVia his radio talk show he covers numerous topics from an international perspective, not usually covered by mainstream media.  The topics on the show are frequently, but not exclusively, related to finance and economics.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.tarpley.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.tarpley.net&lt;/a&gt;\n===============================================================\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n\n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance.
