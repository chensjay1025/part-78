Hitler has ordered that every position must be held until the last, and every lost position recaptured by counter-attack. In the face of overwhelming Allied firepower, Sven and his mates cling to the mountainside knowing they cannot defy the odds for ever. From no-holds-barred descriptions of the frontline combat to partisan attacks and adventures in Rome on leave, MONTE CASSINO is classic Sven Hassel.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0cc5a8c1dfeb3bc6ad048419c087966ff283658","amp;dn":"Monte+Cassino%28The+Beast+Regiment%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0cc5a8c1dfeb3bc6ad048419c087966ff283658","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,204,90,140,29,254,179,188,106,208,72,65,156,8,121,102,255,40,54,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
