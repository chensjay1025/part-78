This meager band must fight for survival as The Order is focused on their total annihilation. Misunderstood and dispised, their journey will be one of desperation against a new, more intensely evil Order. As the hand of this evil is raised to strike and destroy them they must rely on their faith in the abiding power of love to overcome all and lead them to sovereigncy.\n\nSOVEREIGN wonderfuly continues the new testament allegory that was introduced in FORBIDDEN and continued in MORTAL.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5e81129003ef0b6148c17f4808e1b9acc0adec0","amp;dn":"Sovereign+-+Book+3+in+the+book+of+Mortals+series","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5e81129003ef0b6148c17f4808e1b9acc0adec0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,232,17,41,0,62,240,182,20,140,23,244,128,142,27,154,204,10,222,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
