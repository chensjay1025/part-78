No, actually he has two of them. It's not enough that the remaining residents of Earth have pinned their last hope of salvation on him and his mission. He has to find a colony that presumedly was established at an unknown star two centuries before and beg their help. But first, he has the small matter of a mutiny on board his starship, and people are trying to kill him!\nWritten in an era when radios used vacuum tubes, the scientific component of the story is quaint and dated. But Laumer makes the centerpiece of his tale the retelling of how, four years out on the voyage, his crew decides it wants to give up and go home when it meets an alien raceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ that apparently breeds humans in captivity as food animals!\nBeating the aliens, shanghaiing the crew, finding the colony and saving Mother Earth ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ just the ingredients for a rattling good yarn! (summary by Mark F. Smith)\n\n\n\nAn M4B file is an audio file which can be bookmarked. This is the audio-book file type. These files can have chapter markers which can be skipped through as you would skip through files on a play list. They can have built in cover art and chapter images. They will remember where you left off each time you stop the file and come back to it . And variable speed settings on Ipods and a growing number of other mp3 players can be utilized by this file type. The ability to bookmark allows for as little as one large file instead of many small ones without the burden of fast forwarding to find your spot every time you resume listening or the fear of otherwise losing your place. The reduced number of files also makes browsing through your files to find your book and your place in it much less effort.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:721f2c8b2582322150a49b288bb5ef62caa45d1b","amp;dn":"Librivox+M4B+-+Greylorn+by+Keith+Laumer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"721f2c8b2582322150a49b288bb5ef62caa45d1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,31,44,139,37,130,50,33,80,164,155,40,139,181,239,98,202,164,93,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
