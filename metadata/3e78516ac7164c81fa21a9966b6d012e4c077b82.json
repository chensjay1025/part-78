Their plan was simple: to drive an old destroyer packed with three tons of explosive at full speed into the outer gate of the Normandie dock. Destroying this would deny the formidable Tirpitz battleship, currently lurking menacingly in the Norwegian fjords, a base from which it could inflict devastation upon the convoys supplying Britain from the United States. 'Operation Chariot' was dramatically successful, but at a great cost. Fewer than half the men who went on the mission returned. In recognition of their extraordinary bravery, eighty-nine decorations were awarded, including five Victoria Crosses. 'Into the Jaws of Death' is a gripping story of high daring that demonstrates how the decisive courage of a small group of men changed the course of the war.\n\nFollow me on twitter: @livhre\nRequest books on twitter: @livhre\nPlease seed and rate the torrents I upload. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e78516ac7164c81fa21a9966b6d012e4c077b82","amp;dn":"Into+the+Jaws+of+Death%3A+The+True+Story+of+the+Legendary+Raid+on+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e78516ac7164c81fa21a9966b6d012e4c077b82","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,120,81,106,199,22,76,129,250,33,169,150,107,109,1,46,76,7,123,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
