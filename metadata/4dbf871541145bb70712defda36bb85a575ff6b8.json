DS MJ  \n                    Croft deals with a case from the past when a  \n                    couple whose daughter went missing eight years  \n                    ago are convinced they've seen her on a Dover  \n                    beach. MJ is sceptical, but evidence emerges  \n                    that this sighting really could be the abducted  \n                    girl. The team is determined to track her down,  \n                    but Kemplin's sneaky behaviour leads to a  \n                    difficult ending for them all.           \n                                                         \n                                                                                                \n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                          RiPPERS NOTES:                           \n                                                                      \n\n                     \n                        Enjoy this great release from BiA\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                           GROUP NOTES:                            \n                                                                      \n\n                                   Greetz to \n\n                            FoV SFM TBS XiSO SAiNTS\n\n                            love your work boys ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4dbf871541145bb70712defda36bb85a575ff6b8","amp;dn":"Missing.2009.S02E10.HDTV.XviD-BiA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4dbf871541145bb70712defda36bb85a575ff6b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,191,135,21,65,20,91,183,7,18,222,253,163,107,184,90,87,95,246,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
