His sly, whiskey-tinged vocals and lyrical yet blunt guitar can't help but be compared to early, pre-MTV fame ZZ Top, especially when he's getting lecherous on &quot;Oven Burning Woman&quot; (&quot;she really likes my wood&quot;), the self-explanatory, double entendre &quot;Broad Minded,&quot; and &quot;Some Kinda' Momma&quot; (&quot;I'd like to make a momma outta you,&quot; he snarls). While this reads as misogynistic fare, Too Slim, like Top's Billy Gibbons, sings with such a sly, self-deprecating grin, it's impossible not to get caught up in the good-time vibe. On the redemption side is &quot;Walk on Water&quot; that recalls Slim's alcoholic past, the cautionary &quot;Mississippi Moon,&quot; where Slim gets scared straight after being chased by the devil's hounds, and &quot;Soul Perspective,&quot; where he sees the light and finds his clear &quot;soul perspective.&quot; There's no preaching involved as Slim sings the redemptive songs with a leer similar to the sinner ones, leading his rugged two-piece through stripped down, raw, blues rocking licks as if he invented them. While subtlety is not generally a word associated with this outfit, nothing is overstated, either musically or vocally as Slim moseys through the songs with a low-key yet contagious lackadaisical charm that's consistently endearing. He never overplays his guitar either, sort of an anomaly for a three-piece rock band, preferring to let the tunes speak for themselves which they do quite well, even eloquently. \n\n\n\n1.
