The group accumulated numerous charting singles and has sold more than 10 million albums worldwide.\n\nDokken was composed of founder Don Dokken on vocals, George Lynch on lead guitars, Juan Croucier on bass, and Mick Brown on drums. In 1983 Croucier left Dokken in order to join Ratt and was replaced by Jeff Pilson. Currently, Dokken and Brown remain from the original line-up. After several personnel changes on guitar, Dokken's attorney Jon Levin stepped in to fill the role in 2004. In 2001, Barry Sparks replaced Jeff Pilson on the bass guitar.\n\nDokken was first formed around 1978 when Don Dokken teamed up with Jim Monanteras, Greg Leon, and Mick Brown. Prior to this, Don had been playing club shows in the Los Angeles area billed as &quot;Airborn&quot;, but had to change it to Dokken because another band with the same name had already acquired a record deal. In 1979, Don Dokken flew to Germany to sing background vocals on the upcoming Scorpions album Blackout in order to assist the band's vocalist Klaus Meine who was suffering from a vocal ailment. While there, the band Accept was recording in another studio, and its manager was able to secure Don a deal with Carrere Records. Breaking the Chains was first released with this label in Germany under the name &quot;Don Dokken&quot;, but shortly thereafter, Don met up with George Lynch and Mick Brown, who were playing a band called Xciter at the time. With the addition of Juan Croucier, Dokken finally had a steady line-up. Meanwhile in the United States, manager Cliff Bernstein discovered that Dokken was having success in Germany, and signed them in the United States. The band did an arena tour in the United States with Blue ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€œyster Cult in 1983, but when the tour was over the band was left with little money and was nearly dropped from the label due to the album's lack of success.\n\nWhile the band was very popular in Europe during this time, they had not yet made it onto the charts in the United States. Magazines such as Kerrang! blazed the trail for Dokken in the UK.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5291de83e45a370a24eb3d6e1d5a6745028f1dad","amp;dn":"Dokken+-+The+Hunter++%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5291de83e45a370a24eb3d6e1d5a6745028f1dad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,145,222,131,228,90,55,10,36,235,61,110,29,90,103,69,2,143,29,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
