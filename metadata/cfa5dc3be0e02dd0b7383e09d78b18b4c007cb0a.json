The sun is shining, the birds are singing and the lady on \n\nthe corner is handing out free Depends for all of you!\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s our pleasure to present to you 10.2.0.1443 for STL-100-2/3/4 and SQN100-X.\nIt is with great sadness that we report this leak is not available for STL100-1. \n\nWe don't have it, we are not giving anything out for this device with this leak! \n\nSo DO NOT ASK! And Yes, we are sorry for that.\n\nThe procedure is the same for each device, inside each file is an autoloader for \n\neach device; along with a .txt file with the MD5 and SHA-1 values of the \n\nautoloader. Please select the correct OS for your model device. If you don't know \n\nwhich model you have, in any text or BBM field type &quot;myver&quot; - without the \n\nquotation marks - and tap the space bar, and the info you need will appear, \n\nalternatively in Setting &gt; About, you will also find it as well.\n\nBack up all device info! The running of an autoloader *.exe file is a destructive \n\nprocess! You will lose all data on your device, and if your memory card is \n\nencrypted, you will lose all data on your memory card! Please make sure to backup \n\nall information and decrypt your memory cards before going any further!\n\nAfter backing up all information, to your selected locations, SHUT DOWN LINK (if \n\nyou used it for your back up), set your device to airplane mode, connect to your \n\ndevice via USB to the computer. Unzip the downloaded zip file (or unrar in case of \n\nrar file) to your desktop, and start the .exe. Enter any password info, hit enter, \n\nand go make a sandwich, take a shower, whateverÃ¢â‚¬Â¦. Once you see the Welcome Screen \n\non your device, detach from USB, and perform setup. Follow ALL setup prompts. The \n\nfollowing link is a detailed walkthrough of how to load the file onto the device \n\n(there is even a video): *Installing Leaks*\n\nDisclaimer:\nAs per usual we at BerryLeaks and those at Crackberry are NOT responsible for any \n\ndamage done to your device.\n\n\nSTL100-2/3/4\n\n\nThe following devices are NOT supported:\nSTL100-1\n\nThe following is a list of changed files compared to the latest leak we released \n\nfor Z10 - 10.2.0.1323\n\nUpdated files in 1443\ncom.rim.bb.app.adobeReader-10.1.6.43\ncom.rim.bb.app.facebook-10.2.1.13\ncom.rim.bb.app.retaildemoshim-127.1.0.43\ncom.tcs.maps-10.2.0.360\nsys.airtunes-10.200.0.48\nsys.android.shell-10.2.0.97\nsys.android-10.2.0.97\nsys.appworld-4.4.0.90\nsys.bb_screen_reader-1.0.0.75\nsys.bbm-10.2.0.42\nsys.browser-10.2.0.42\nsys.btviewer-10.2.0.62\nsys.calculator-10.2.0.143\nsys.camera-10.200.0.57\nsys.cfs.box-1.2.0.74\nsys.chat-10.2.0.433\nsys.chatblend-10.2.0.399\nsys.clock-11.20.0.154\nsys.data.asr-10.2.0.39\nsys.data.carrier_data-10.2.0.386\nsys.data.imf.root-10.2.0.8\nsys.data.quip.authtokens-10.2.0.449\nsys.dxtg.launcher-10.12.0.85\nsys.dxtg.sstg-10.12.0.85\nsys.dxtg.stg-10.12.0.85\nsys.dxtg.wtg-10.12.0.85\nsys.escreens-10.2.0.772\nsys.filepicker-10.11.0.111\nsys.firstlaunch-10.2.0.7393\nsys.help-10.2.0.17\nsys.hotspotBrowser-10.2.0.42\nsys.howto-10.2.0.28\nsys.invokeTargetSelection-1.0.0.53\nsys.mediaplayer-10.2.0.47\nsys.miracastviewer-1.0.0.84\nsys.mmagic-10.2.0.54\nsys.paymentsystem-10.2.3.157\nsys.perimeterbrowser-10.11.0.111\nsys.phone_settings-10.2.0.673\nsys.phone-10.2.0.525\nsys.pictures-10.200.0.157\nsys.picturesviewer-10.200.0.157\nsys.pim.attachments.card-10.2.0.566\nsys.pim.calendar.viewer.eventcreate-10.102.1.511\nsys.pim.calendar.viewer.ics-10.102.1.511\nsys.pim.calendar.viewer.nav-10.102.1.511\nsys.pim.calendar-10.102.1.511\nsys.pim.contacts-10.5.200.379\nsys.pim.email.card-10.2.0.609\nsys.pim.email.composer.card-10.2.1.580\nsys.pim.messages-10.2.0.607\nsys.pim.remember-10.2.0.602\nsys.places.cards-10.2.0.54\nsys.rcse-10.2.0.330\nsys.settings.accounts-1.0.0.133\nsys.settings-10.2.0.7639\nsys.settings2-10.2.0.7556\nsys.setupbuffet-10.2.0.7531\nsys.smartcalling-10.2.0.334\nsys.smartcard-10.2.0.67\nsys.smarttags-10.2.0.409\nsys.socialconnect.facebook-10.1.1.88\nsys.socialconnect.linkedin-10.1.0.191\nsys.socialconnect.twitter-10.1.1.88\nsys.socialconnect.youtube-10.1.1.88\nsys.videochat-10.2.0.18\nsys.videoplayer-10.200.0.49\nsys.voicemailcompose-1.0.0.73\nsys.voicemailsetup-10.2.0.64\nsys.weather-10.2.0.124\nsys.wifisendcard-10.2.0.13\n\nThe following is a list of found defects or general notices:\nGeneral Notice: This is a full OS including radio file\n\nIssue: Android VM sometimes crashes and reboots the phone\nSolution: none\n\nIssue: No Facebook check-ins for some people\nSolution: Do not restore from last backup, instead install OS and start fresh \n\n(please note: without restore you will lose saved data such as progress in games \n\nor data in third party apps like password manager or note-taking apps)\n\nIssue: Restoring data may corrupt contacts database (rare issue)\nSolution: Do not restore from last backup, instead install OS and start fresh \n\n(please note: without restore you will lose saved data such as progress in games \n\nor data in third party apps like password manager or note-taking apps)\n\nGeneral Notice: No Wi-Fi Direct for Z\n\nGeneral Notice: Android Runtime is locked on this leak.
