But when  \n                    the club faces closure due to Jock's debt with  \n                    Paddy, Ian enlists Maxine, Carl and Chesney to  \n                    help raise funds. However, it soon becomes  \n                    clear that Ian has stumbled into a hornet's  \n                    nest of unfinished business between Paddy and  \n                    Jock. Meanwhile, a moment of heroism prompts  \n                    Micky to apply for a job with the fire service,  \n                    but during the assessment he is weighed down by  \n                    a familiar spectre of doubt. Returning a  \n                    failure, he feels wounded, but his handling of  \n                    a life-threatening emergency proves that he  \n                    deserves respect. At the Gallaghers', Libby's  \n                    biological clock is in overdrive and to Frank's  \n                    utter horror, she makes it clear she wants to  \n                    have children of her own before it's too late.  \n                    Elsewhere, Liam is targeted by bullies, while  \n                    Karen sets up a 'Chatsworth's Got Talent' night  \n                    at The Jockey.
