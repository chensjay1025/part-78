(have a good summer) West Coast Music on Bikes Tour, tackled by the aforementioned fellows, hailing from Salt Lake City, Utah, was a simple plan, really.\n\nIt went like this:\n\nBike down the west coast of the U.S. of A. Take their noise-making machines. Play shows in all the little and large towns along the way.\n\nWhen Chaz and James got bored, they composed ditties of varying lengths, along the way. In San Fran, they swooped up their pal Kazoo, who brought the angels down.\n\nKazoo flew away in LA, and Ian Accord fell into her gap. Steve lent his limbs to the project back in Salt Lake.\n\nThey now operate as a powerful fourpiece. Enjoy.\n\nYou can view our website here!
