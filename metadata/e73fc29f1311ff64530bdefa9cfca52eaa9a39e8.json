On modern machines either audio plays faster than video, or video goes faster than audio, which makes the game nearly unplayable.\n\nJust install the patch and start the game using the shortcut, as usual.\nIf you want to start the game without using the shortcut for whatever reason, start it using &quot;FullProcessing.exe&quot; file. It should be somewhere in game folder.\n\n\nPlease keep in mind that nearly all (or all) my torrents are UNIQUE. Which means that if seeds will drop and torrent will die, people may never get this stuff again.\nAnd in this particular case it means that people will not be able to normally replay this amazing game on modern machines.\n\nSo please, keep seeding.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e73fc29f1311ff64530bdefa9cfca52eaa9a39e8","amp;dn":"Beyond+Good+%26+Evil+-+Audio-Video+De-synchronization+Patch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e73fc29f1311ff64530bdefa9cfca52eaa9a39e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,63,194,159,19,17,255,100,83,11,222,250,156,252,165,46,170,154,57,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
