Never again has it been possible for man to believe that harmony is in fact the truth of all existence.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nThis elegantly-written work provides a splendid introduction to the Greeks of the classic period: how they thought, wrote, and organized their lives and loves. Although it dates from the 1890s, there is very little about it that has dated. To its author's credit, the subject of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGreek loveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is dealt with in a sane and factual context - despite the judicial assassination of Oscar Wilde going on in the background.\n\nA Cambridge don much admired by his students (including E. M. Forster), Goldsworthy Lowes Dickinson belonged to the Apostles, a secret society with a strong ethic of male friendship. Alfred Tennyson and his beloved Arthur Hallam were early members. Dickinson is chiefly remembered as a historian and pacifist who played a significant part in the founding of the League of Nations. Inevitably, given his interests and intellectual background, he became a close associate of the Bloomsbury Group.\n\nThe Greek View of Life is no dry academic tome. It is a popularizing work in the best sense: accessibly written and illustrated with apt quotations given in sturdy translations, never in the original Greek. It is a joy to read.\n(Introduction by Martin Geeson)\n\n\n\nAn M4B file is an audio file which can be bookmarked. This is the audio-book file type. These files can have chapter markers which can be skipped through as you would skip through files on a play list. They can have built in cover art and chapter images. They will remember where you left off each time you stop the file and come back to it . And variable speed settings on Ipods and a growing number of other mp3 players can be utilized by this file type. The ability to bookmark allows for as little as one large file instead of many small ones without the burden of fast forwarding to find your spot every time you resume listening or the fear of otherwise losing your place. The reduced number of files also makes browsing through your files to find your book and your place in it much less effort.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ac20b3f660b908d134869eb1d236b0d3deef018","amp;dn":"Librivox+M4B+-+Greek+View+of+Life+by+Goldsworthy+Lowes+Dickinson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ac20b3f660b908d134869eb1d236b0d3deef018","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,194,11,63,102,11,144,141,19,72,105,235,29,35,107,13,61,238,240,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
