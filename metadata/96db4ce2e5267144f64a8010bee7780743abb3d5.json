Syncing audio was a bitch. The original master of this particular movie has an excessive amount of DNR applied and was extremely hard to fix without making it worse. Video was taken from German source that incidentally had only German audio (from MaGic) but is the best source for this movie nevertheless. Audio and subs was taken from the NTSC source and it was indeed a very interesting process to sync the audio with the PAL source. The interesting part was that the NTSC originally came from a PAL master so it wasn't a 23.976-&gt;25 conversion that the audio or subs needed. The German source had about 3 different places where the audio and subs delay changed and so I had to pinpoint the exact areas where that occurred, cut the audio at those places, then apply different delays and join the parts. Subs were easier since Subtitle Workshop is such an efficient software. The whole movie was filled with this horrible and disgusting blue/green tint and there were different levels of this problem throughout. Sharpening was something special in this source and trust me it is after much analysis and thought that I applied it. In the end what you have here is what I can guarantee to be the BEST print of this movie out there. I did the best I could and if it is not up to your expectations then I apologize. Enjoy! \n\nNote Join Mastitorrents","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96db4ce2e5267144f64a8010bee7780743abb3d5","amp;dn":"Namastey+London.2007.DVDRiP.x264.Hindi+AC3+5.1+CH.Chapters+%26+Sub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96db4ce2e5267144f64a8010bee7780743abb3d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,219,76,226,229,38,113,68,246,74,128,16,190,231,120,7,67,171,179,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
