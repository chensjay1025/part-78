Marie's boyfriend picks up the two sisters from Marie's job &quot;Pup n' Fries&quot; and Marie announces to him that Cherie has gotten her period. Angry at her sister for telling, she informs Marie's boyfriend that Marie is not wearing any underwear. Later Cherie is seen cutting her hair in a shag and putting on face makeup in an attempt to create a David Bowie type look. The scene is accompanied by scenes of Joan huffing marijuana with her girlfriend. Cherie is later seen lip-syncing David Bowie at the school talent show and is the target of paper balls, to which Cherie reacts by flipping off the crowd, but wins the talent show.\n\nJoan is making out with a guy outside a club when she sees record producer Kim Fowley. Joan approaches him and talks about starting an all-girl rock band. Kim is interested and introduces Joan to Sandy West, a drummer. Joan and Sandy become friends and start jamming when Kim suggests that they recruit a hot blonde.\n\nAt a club, Kim and Joan look for hot blondes and come over Cherie. They ask if she wants to be in a band and she accepts. Then they tell her to come to auditions in a trailer park in the valley.\n\nCherie learns the cover song of Suzie Quatro's &quot;Fever&quot; and goes to audition, however they're disappointed at the song. Instead, Kim kicks Cherie out of the trailer and with Joan, thinks of a song for Cherie to audition for, thus writing Cherry Bomb. Cherie sings it and after improving, is part of the band.\n\n\nDirected by Floria Sigismondi \nProduced by Bill Pohlad\nArt Linson\nJohn Linson\nJoan Jett\nKenny Laguna \nWritten by Floria Sigismondi \nStarring\nDakota Fanning\nKristen Stewart\nStella Maeve\nScout Taylor-Compton\nMichael Shannon","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2d4e44dbeee67c45a451a26e90011d6d432de21","amp;dn":"The+Runaways+2010+DVDScreener","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2d4e44dbeee67c45a451a26e90011d6d432de21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,212,228,77,190,238,103,196,90,69,26,38,233,0,17,214,212,50,222,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
