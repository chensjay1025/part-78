Turn-based gameplay and pretty straight-forward story... nothing to write home about. Still worth a try maybe. I been on it a few hours and plan to see things through to the end. DRM-FREE, JUST INSTALL AND GOOOOOOOOOO! BTW, the developers describe the game as 'roguelike', but there's nothing roguelike about it (no permadeath, easy gameplay, NOT especially random), nahhhhhhhh.\n--------------------------------------\n\nDescription:\nBattlepaths is an addictive 2D-RPG featuring neat monster hacking, an excellent loot system, and great variety in character development. Learn skills, use powerfull potions, and hunt down the Chaos Overlord. \nBattlepaths offers a sophisticated drop system that generates countless different items along with more than 50 unique items. The character customization allows you to create a unique hero with its own strengths and weaknesses. You can build a heavy, damage dealing tank, a deadly ninja that utilizes high speed and agility to attack his victims from out of nowhere, a true master of mind who crushes his foes with powerful combinations of special abilities, or something in between. \nYou can choose to play in different realms that each have their own landscape and their own set of creatures. The many superior items you will find can be exchanged between different characters, one of which will eventually become the first powerful enough to face the Chaos Overlord. \nPrepare yourself for Battlepaths! \n\nKey Features:\n-Loot (so much loot...) \n-Highly customizable character development \n-Turn-Based, strategic combat \n-summon creatures to fight on your side \n-subtle use of special skills and powerful potions required \n-fast paced hacking in easier battles \n-challenging boss fights\n-Roguelike gameplay, simple and absorbing \n-Three big realms to explore, plus an additional challenge realm \n-25+ hours of gameplay \n-High replay value \n-Unique graphics \n-Unique soundtrack \n-Over 50 unique items\n\n\nMinimum Requirements:\n-Windows XP/Vista/Windows 7\n-DirectX 9.0c\n-512MB Memory\n-1.6Ghz CPU\n-XNA Redistributable 4.0\n-.NET Framework 4.0\n\n\n--------------------------------------\n*Absolutely 100% clean and working!*\n*My upload ain't the best, but I'll seed this forever!*\n*BUY the games you reallllly dig!!!*\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97e2f0ce202a94cf0ffc44bc22032fa5f48853d8","amp;dn":"Battlepaths+1.5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97e2f0ce202a94cf0ffc44bc22032fa5f48853d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,226,240,206,32,42,148,207,15,252,68,188,34,3,47,165,244,136,83,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
