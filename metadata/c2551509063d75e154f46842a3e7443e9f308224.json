The pub is run by brothers, the nervous Barry and the idiotic Garry. The only regular of the pub is Dodgy Phil. Every episode revolves around one of Dodgy Phil's plans to improve the pub, a plan which Barry always has doubts about. The doubts are often confirmed due to the pub's destruction at the end of every episode. One of the running jokes in the series is that, as the pub is next to a zoo, unusual animals are often found inside it.\n\n\n\n\n\nCast: \nPhil Cornwell as Barry\nJohn Thomson as Dodgy Phil\nPeter Serafinowicz as Garry [ 1 ]\nAlistair McGowan as Garry [ 2 ]\nKim Wall\nDebra Stephenson\n\n\nWriter - Tony Roache.\nMusic by Bill Bailey.\n\nWorld Of Pub - S01 - E01 - The Oldest Pub In The World\nWorld Of Pub - S01 - E02 - The Environmentally Friendly Pub\nWorld Of Pub - S01 - E03 - The Biggest Pub In The World\nWorld Of Pub - S01 - E04 - The 500th Anniversary Of The East End\n\nWorld Of Pub - S02 - E01 - The Millennium Pub Experience\nWorld Of Pub - S02 - E02 - The Miracle Pub\nWorld Of Pub - S02 - E03 - The First Ever Pub Olympics\nWorld Of Pub - S02 - E04 - The East End Gangster Awards\n\n\n\n\nAudio Format : MP3\nDuration : 15 &amp; 30mn\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nResolution : 16 bits\n\n[b]A number of people are posting my torrents on other trackers.\nI have no problem with that - (Not much need as I already do this) - But a name check would be nice\nI was the one who spent weeks,months,years recording them[/b]\n\n.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2551509063d75e154f46842a3e7443e9f308224","amp;dn":"World+Of+Pub+-+S01+%26+02+-+Audio+Comedy+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2551509063d75e154f46842a3e7443e9f308224","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,85,21,9,6,61,117,225,84,244,104,66,163,231,68,62,159,48,130,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
