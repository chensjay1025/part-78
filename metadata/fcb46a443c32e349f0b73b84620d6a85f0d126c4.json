Four anti-Apartheid activists, including their leader, Matthew Goniwe, a popular teacher from the small town of Cradock, were in the ambushed car. They had been secretly targeted for political assassination. The police abducted him and his companions, Fort Calata, Sparrow Mkonto and Sicelo Mhlauli, and murdered them in cold blood. To cover their tracks, they mutilated and set fire to the bodies. The burnt remains of Ã‚â€œthe Cradock Four&quot;, as they came to be known, were later found near the Port Elizabeth suburb of Bluewater Bay. The murders became one of ApartheidÃ‚â€™s murkiest and most controversial episodes. \nThe film allows the viewer to perceive the oppressive climate of the sombre racist regime in the seventies and early eighties. It shows how the system broke the freedom, and the lives, of these four young men. Using compelling archive materials, incisive interviews and dramatic recreations, the film approaches the ideals which led Matthew and his friends to support the then-banned African National Congress (ANC). It helps the viewer evaluate the circumstances that led to the rise of opposition in the country and singles out MatthewÃ‚â€™s contribution, which led to the creation of South AfricaÃ‚â€™s first Ã‚â€œliberated zoneÃ‚â€. The assassinations signalled the Ã‚â€œBeginning of the EndÃ‚â€ of this racist Apartheid regime, and paved the way for the election of Nelson Mandela as South AfricaÃ‚â€™s first democratic president in 1994.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img835.imageshack.us/img835/3576/9xkf.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img835.imageshack.us/img835/3576/9xkf.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img6.imageshack.us/img6/5106/hrax.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img6.imageshack.us/img6/5106/hrax.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img46.imageshack.us/img46/5994/i3q0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img46.imageshack.us/img46/5994/i3q0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img825.imageshack.us/img825/2040/j8o2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img825.imageshack.us/img825/2040/j8o2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img43.imageshack.us/img43/1980/27jz.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img43.imageshack.us/img43/1980/27jz.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img585.imageshack.us/img585/9681/8c3p.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img585.imageshack.us/img585/9681/8c3p.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: x264 ,AVC-1\nVideo Bitrate: CRF 20\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio BitRate: 192 kbps\nAudio Streams: 2.0\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime Per Part: 51 min\nNumber Of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 1.2 GB\nRipped by Hukumuzuku\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Related Documentaries &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=The%20World%20Against%20Apartheid&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=The%20World%20Against%20Apartheid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Mandela%3A%20Son%20Of%20Africa%2C%20Father%20Of%20A%20Nation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Mandela%3A%20Son%20Of%20Africa%2C%20Father%20Of%20A%20Nation&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=South%20Africa%3A%20The%20Massacre%20That%20Changed%20a%20Nation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=South%20Africa%3A%20The%20Massacre%20That%20Changed%20a%20Nation&lt;/a&gt;\n\n2)  ed2k Links \n\n\n&quot;ed2k://|file|ICTV.Political.Assassinations.The.Cradock.Murders.HDTV.x264.720p.AC3.MVGroup.org.mkv|1283168208|73e6486e97ef8a21a0b020afbb2fd703|/&quot;\n\n\n\n\nAdded by &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=User%3AHukumuzuku&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=User%3AHukumuzuku&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSource: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=The_Cradock_Murders&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=The_Cradock_Murders&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fcb46a443c32e349f0b73b84620d6a85f0d126c4","amp;dn":"ICTV+Political+Assassinations+The+Cradock+Murders+x264+720p+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fcb46a443c32e349f0b73b84620d6a85f0d126c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,180,106,68,60,50,227,73,240,183,59,132,98,13,106,133,240,209,38,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
