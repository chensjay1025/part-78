Executive Producers Meredith Stiehm (Homeland) and novelist and television writer/producer Elwood Reid adapted The Bridge for American television from the international hit series Bron, which was set on the border of Denmark and Sweden.\n\nIn The Bridge, DemiÃƒÂ¡n Bichir stars in the role of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Marco Ruiz,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a homicide investigator for the state of Chihuahua, Mexico living in Ciudad JuÃƒÂ¡rez. A family man, Marco is one of the last good men in a corrupt and apathetic police force that is outgunned by the powerful drug cartels. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sharp, charming, and observant and painfully aware that his city is in a state of chaos. When a body is dumped on the bridge that spans the El Paso-Ciudad JuÃƒÂ¡rez border, Ruiz is forced to work with his American counterpart, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Detective Sonya Cross.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Diane Kruger stars as Ã¢â‚¬Å“Detective Sonya Cross,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a dogged cop who has an undiagnosed disorder that falls on the autism spectrum. Cross is shockingly candid and calls the world as she sees it, which can be off-putting to her colleagues, but she is also extremely effective at her job.\n\nTed Levine plays Ã¢â‚¬Å“Lieutenant Hank Wade,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a member of Detective CrossÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s team at the El Paso Police Department who is a veteran cop with a weathered, cowboy swagger. He is not surprised by anything that human beings will do to one another, he is utterly baffled by the office coffeemaker. Hank knows that Sonya communication skills are challenged, and repeatedly has to advise her how to work more diplomatically with others. Annabeth Gish plays Ã¢â‚¬Å“Charlotte Millwright,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a wealthy ranch wife suddenly widowed when her older husband Karl suffers a massive heart attack while on the Mexican side of the border. A sheltered woman with a ranch to run, Charlotte quickly learns that her late husband has many shocking secrets. Thomas M. Wright plays Ã¢â‚¬Å“Steven Linder,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a wolf of a man who is no stranger to the dark and jumbled chaos of JuÃƒÂ¡rez.\n\nMatthew Lillard plays Ã¢â‚¬Å“Daniel Frye,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a cocky reporter with the El Paso Times whose hard partying ways have taken a toll on his once promising journalism career.\n\n\n\n04\nMaria of the Desert\nThe clock ticks as Maria's broadcast continues. Sonya searches for the girl's location. Against protocol, Marco works a unique ransom angle. A powerful Juarez force crosses the border.\n\nimage\nÃ¢Ë†Â©Ã¢â€¢â€”Ã¢â€ï¿½General\nFormat : Matroska\nFormat version : Version 4 / Version 2\nFile size : 408 MiB\nDuration : 40mn 54s\nOverall bit rate : 1 393 Kbps\nEncoded date : UTC 2013-08-01 16:58:30\nWriting application : mkvmerge v6.2.0 ('Promisimageed Land') built on Apr 28 2013 12:22:01\nWriting library : libebml v1.3.0 + libmatroska v1.4.0\n\nVideo\nID : 1\nFormat : AVC\nFormat/Info : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;e4ac8d838ca4a8d0cad5&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames : 14 frames\nCodec ID : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nDuration : 40mn 54s\nBit rate : 1 010 Kbps\nWidth : 1 280 pixels\nHeight : 720 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\nFrame rate mode : Constant\nFrame rate : 23.976 fps\nColor space : YUV\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\nBit depth : 8 bits\nScan type : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.046\nStream size : 287 MiB (70%)\nWriting library : x264 core 136 r2348+704+51 d1baef6 tMod [8-bit@all X86]\nDefault : Yes\nForced : No\n\nAudio\nID : 2\nFormat : AC-3\nFormat/Info : Audio Coding 3\nMode extension : CM (complete main)\nFormat settings, Endianness : Big\nCodec ID : A_AC3\nDuration : 40mn 54s\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 384 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 6 channels\nChannel positions : Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nBit depth : 16 bits\nCompression mode : Lossy\nStream size : 112 MiB (28%)\nDefault : Yes\nForced : No\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ed95f1ea0bcc93417945c83d34cb99078c53528","amp;dn":"The+Bridge+%28US%29+S01E04+720p+x264+%5BMKV%2CAC3%2C5.1%5D+Ehhhh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ed95f1ea0bcc93417945c83d34cb99078c53528","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,217,95,30,160,188,201,52,23,148,92,131,211,76,185,144,120,197,53,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
