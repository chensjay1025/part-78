Told by doctors that he   \n probably has only months to live, Ed agrees to an       \n experimental treatment: doses of the hormone cortisone. \n Ed makes a remarkable recovery, and returns home to his \n wife, Lou, and their son, Richie. He must keep taking   \n cortisone tablets regularly to prevent a recurrence of  \n his illness. But the &quot;miracle&quot; cure turns into its own  \n nightmare as Ed starts to abuse the tablets, causing    \n him to experience increasingly wild mood swings.        \n                                                         \n\n\n\n\n  C A S T  \n\n\n                                                         \n                                                         \n               James Mason ...
