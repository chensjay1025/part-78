After the earth has become uninhabitable due to an ecological collapse, the remaining people live on overcrowded space stations in earthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s orbit. The young doctor Laura Portmann is one of them. She hopes for a better future on the distant planet Rhea. But to get there she needs money. She signs up for a job on the derelict cargo ship Kassandra, heading for a 4 year flight to Station 42.\nThe crew members spend the most time of the fully automated flight in deep sleep while, in 8 months shifts, always one person stays awake to monitor the space ship. Due to the current terrorist threat there is also an additional security person aboard: Samuel Decker. Toward the end of her shift, Laura Portmann hears unusual noises from the cargo bay, and she feels observed. Her colleagues will be awakened, and together, the crew sets out to investigate the cold cargo space. They make gruesome discoveries.\nAfter the first death, it is clear that on the Kassandra bad things are happening. Everyone begins to distrust the other. Laura Portmann, together with Decker uncovers the real destination of the cargo ship, learns what secret cargo they transport, and discover a large-scale fraud.\n\nCountry: Switzerland\n\n\nAudio : German DD 5.1 - 448 Kbps     \n\nSubs : English, Portuguese, Dutch, Chinese, Romanian, Slovenian, Vietnamese,\n\n2.35 : 1\n\n120 min \n\nNTSC\n\n\nRegular DVDR converted from a BluRayRip , playable on a standalone dvd player.\n\nCustom sub found on the web.
