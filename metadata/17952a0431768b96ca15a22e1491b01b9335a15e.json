After five long months of toil and tears, she achieved\n      a remarkable, lasting transformation, overhauling dismal\n      donations and shocking stock and reinventing their dowdy stores.\n      But she's not finished yet. Six months later, she's returning to\n      add the last piece to the jigsaw, with an idea to overhaul the\n      loyal but ageing workforce and bring in a new breed of\n      volunteer.\n      \n     \n                                                      Group Notes...\n        We are looking for:                           \n                                                                     \n      .EU Affil sites, NO COLO/RENTED.                              \n                                                                     \n      Retail TV dvds before the retail date.                        \n                                                                     \n      Can't get in contact with us?
