But the young Tory becomes smitten by his attractive opponent, Labour candidate\nStella Stoker (Patricia Bredin). As the election looms, the candidate's respective agents join forces to become obstacles on the pair's path to true love. Brilliantly performed, not least by Sim as the avaricious uncle, and blessed with an abundance of supporting character comedians, the film also succeeds as a deft political satire.\n\nFeature Running Time: 95 mins approx Feature Aspect Ratio: 1.33: 1\nIAN CARMICHAEL ALASTAIR SIM IN &quot;LEFT RIGHT AND CENTRE&quot; AlSO STARRING PATRICIA BREDIN RICHARD WATTIS ERIC BARKER ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY BY SIDNEY GILLIAT AND VAL VALENTINE\nPRODUCED BY FRANK LAUNDER AND SIDNEY GILLIAT DIRECTED BY SIDNEY GILLIAT\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â©1959 VALE FILM PRODUCTIONS.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22974cca84e4e725b88096666315a1657a678a5e","amp;dn":"Left+Right+and+Centre+%281959%29+%28Alastair+Sim%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22974cca84e4e725b88096666315a1657a678a5e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,151,76,202,132,228,231,37,184,128,150,102,99,21,161,101,122,103,138,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
