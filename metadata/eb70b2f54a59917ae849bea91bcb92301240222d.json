Ultimate Edition was built off Ultimate Edition 2.6 (Ubuntu Lucid Lynx 10.04). Major difference being that is has been fully updated / upgraded and has the following environments, user selectable at the login screen:\n\n* KDE\n* XFCE\n* Gnome\n* LXDE\n* Openbox\n\nI am not going to do a huge write up on this O/S, I am sure it will be downloaded more then Ultimate Edition 2.6 was. I have said in the past, I am not a KDE man it looks too much like that &quot;Other O/S&quot; wink.gif I will return to Ultimate Edition 2.6. That does not mean our users are not interested in exploring / using these environments.\n\nI have included a Conky script I wrote that will generate as per each computer. The results of running the Conky script can be seen at the right. This script will be in your home folder when installed (your choice to run it or not). The script is commented if you wish to learn.\n\n\nRelease Name: Ultimate Edition 2.7\nArchitecture: x86 (32 bit)\nRelease Base: Ultimate Edition 2.6 (Lucid)\nEnvironments: KDE, Gnome, LXDE, XFCE, Openbox\nFilesize: 2.4 GB (2,563,768,320 bytes)\nMD5SUM: 0b82382322790c27a43f3d8815f09001","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb70b2f54a59917ae849bea91bcb92301240222d","amp;dn":"Ultimate+Edition+2.7+DVD+x86","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb70b2f54a59917ae849bea91bcb92301240222d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,112,178,245,74,89,145,122,232,73,190,169,27,203,146,48,18,64,34,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
