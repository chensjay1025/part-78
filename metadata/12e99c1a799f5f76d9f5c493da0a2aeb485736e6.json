Three issues spanning three years it's no wonder the series didn't take off but a great series nonetheless.\n\n Bernie Mireault's 'Jammer' is one of the most creative and engaging takes on life and super-heroics in years. It's a refreshing combination of adventure and pathos that is neither cliche nor a spoof. The Jam is an original.\n\n ENJOY\n\n The Caliber Press run will be coming soon...
