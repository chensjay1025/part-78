It has been hailed by many as the most significant expatriate African film. It owes its title to an old song that the African slaves used to sing aboard ships on their way to the West Indies. Since slaves were the first Africans forced from their native land, Honda aptly selects this song to name his film, which is about the alienation of contemporary black Africans working in France.\n\nPLEASE SEED AT LEAST AS MUCH AS YOU DOWNLOAD SO THIS TORRENT WILL NEVER DIE!
