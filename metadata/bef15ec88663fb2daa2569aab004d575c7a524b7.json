The first part was originally advertised as an &quot;ABC Family Original Movie&quot;, but nearly a year later, it was followed up with two other parts of equal length over the course of a weekend. Fallen stars Paul Wesley as Aaron Corbett, a good-natured high school student who discovers he is half-human/half-angel. The series inspired a reality game on abcfamily.com which won an interactive Emmy.&quot;\n\n\nPart one: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5266109\nPart three: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5547053","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bef15ec88663fb2daa2569aab004d575c7a524b7","amp;dn":"Fallen+part+2+-+The+Journey","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bef15ec88663fb2daa2569aab004d575c7a524b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,241,94,200,134,99,251,45,170,37,105,170,176,4,213,117,199,165,36,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
