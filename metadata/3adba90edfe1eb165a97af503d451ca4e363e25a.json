Get too complacent and all sorts of weirdos start coming out of the woodwork. Good thing Sam &amp; Max are here to hose down the sleaze and keep some kind of peace. Violently, if possible. Who are these irreverent crime fighters? Sam's a six-foot tall canine shamus with a love of justice. Max is a hyperkinetic rabbity-thing with a taste for mayhem. Together, they're a team of freelance police officers, on a mission to take down a bizarre mind-control conspiracy. And they're bringing you along for the fun. Sam &amp; Max are finally back with their hilarious and critically-acclaimed first season of the Sam &amp; Max adventures -- and now, all six episodes of the first season are here in one box to own and enjoy.
