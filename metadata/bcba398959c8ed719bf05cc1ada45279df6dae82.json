They send little virtual spiders or bots out to search the web's blogs and forums for millions of postings in all the primary languages. All these postings are then distilled down into how the posters unconsciously feel about the future.\n\nThe theory is that if enough posters feel a certain way about a future event, it will happen that way. The problem is that strong negative feelings in people's postings are much louder than positive feelings. This results in much of the data having a negative slant.\n\nAccording to the bots, we're in for a rough ride this year, starting with the economy in early July, and with World War 3 on schedule to start in early November.\n\n\nClif High's website is http://www.halfpasthuman.com\nGeorge Ure's website is http://www.urbansurvival.com\n\n~Edited out commercials and long bumpers\n~Re-encoded the bigger files @ 32kbps VBR to save space\n~Normalized the ones with erratic or low volume\n~Added ID3 tags so you can see what's playing all mp3 players\n~Added album art, just to make it cool ;-)\n~Split the bigger files into segments of 80min. or less so they can be burnt to audio CD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bcba398959c8ed719bf05cc1ada45279df6dae82","amp;dn":"Web+Bot+Project+Interviews+2004+thru+2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bcba398959c8ed719bf05cc1ada45279df6dae82","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,186,57,137,89,200,237,113,155,240,92,193,173,164,82,121,223,109,174,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
