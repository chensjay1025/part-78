Fight to the bitter end.&quot;               \n    Those were everyday words to combat troops             \n    on both sides at the end of World War II in            \n        the Pacific. And they led to an                        \n        unprecedented orgy of slaughter. In this               \n        provocative, thorough examination of the               \n    final months of the war, this film looks at               \n    the escalation of bloodletting from the                    \n    vantage point of both the Japanese and the                 \n    Americans. As the film will show, most of              \n        the Emperor's inner circle was determined to           \n        continue the war even after losses in the              \n        Philippines in February 1945 cut off Japan's           \n    supply lines.                                          \n                                                           \n                                                           \n                 \n                                                 \n                                                     \n                                                     \n                                                               \n    WWII Vets  ...
