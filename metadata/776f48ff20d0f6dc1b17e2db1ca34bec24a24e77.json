Variously hustlers, dealers, rap stars, daughters, and mothers, these women have known both hardship and success, and their perspective on their roots is both enlightening and sobering.\n\nIn addition to a wide assortment of &quot;regular people&quot;, Champagne, Ice-T, Lil' Kim, Mary J. Blige, Tupac Shakur, Vanessa Del Rio and plenty more make appearances. They do not lead the plot (if there is one), they just have opinions.. like everybody else in this movie.\n\nTo put it bluntly, this is not rapsploitation. It's life.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:776f48ff20d0f6dc1b17e2db1ca34bec24a24e77","amp;dn":"Gangstresses.DOCU.DVDRip.XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"776f48ff20d0f6dc1b17e2db1ca34bec24a24e77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,111,72,255,32,208,246,220,27,23,226,219,28,163,75,236,36,162,78,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
