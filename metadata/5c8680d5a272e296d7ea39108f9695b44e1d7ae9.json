I first discovered their classic track &quot;Between Two Hearts&quot; on the fantastic Retronics compilation, which collects several of their peers. Whereas other Swedish synthpop bands like the Mobile Homes earned some cult success in the States, Samedi wasn't able to achieve the same success despite a similar sound. Otherwise, the band formed in 1983 as a four piece, and fluxuated between three and four members throughout the course of the 1980s.\n\nThe band's discography consists of three 7'' singles and one full length record. All of their releases were pressed via Canned Music, the band's own label. After calling it a day in 1990, members of Samedi focused their efforts on manning a recording studio, producing, writing, and engineering several more Italo-tinged bands over the years. Check their discogs page for some of the tracks the band worked on.\n\nWithout any further ado, here's the information for their 1989 full length, Doubts &amp; Beliefs.\n\nSamedi- Doubts &amp; Beliefs LP\n1.
