This strategy entails negotiating for terms in international treaties that might prove too politically unpopular to pass in national assemblies. Similar terms and provisions currently appear in the World Customs Organization draft SECURE treaty, and critics have argued that the anticircumvention provisions of Title I of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act were similarly passed after policy laundering via treaties negotiated through the World Intellectual Property Organization.\n\nA document leaked to the public in 2008 includes a provision to force Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to provide information about suspected copyright infringers without a warrant. A March 2010 leak included the proposed text for this provision.\n\nThe negotiations for the ACTA treaty are conducted behind closed doors and are not part of any international organisation.[2] In October 2007 the USA, the European Commission, Switzerland and Japan first announced that they would negotiate ACTA. Since then the following countries joined the negotiations: Australia, Canada, Jordan, Mexico, Morocco, New Zealand, Republic of Korea, Singapore and United Arab Emirates.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f9bd39f93002decc0d4598b7f15d31f92a4a3db","amp;dn":"Anti-Counterfeiting+Trade+Agreement+%28ACTA%29+draft%2C+18%2F1%2F2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f9bd39f93002decc0d4598b7f15d31f92a4a3db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,155,211,159,147,0,45,236,192,212,89,139,127,21,211,31,146,164,163,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
