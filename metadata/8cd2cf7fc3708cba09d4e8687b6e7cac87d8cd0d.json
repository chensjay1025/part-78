It featured British singer Cathy Dennis, credited as &quot;introducing&quot; her. Even though it was not Dennis's first solo single, it established her as a major chart presence during the late 1980s to early 1990s.\n\nThe song peaked at #15 on the UK Singles Chart, which was quite moderate, considering the major Top 10 success she would achieve on this chart in the future. In the U.S., &quot;C'mon and Get My Love&quot; is the song most closely identified with D Mob, as the song crossed over to pop radio, and hit #10 on the Billboard Hot 100. It also topped the American dance chart, becoming the biggest hit of D Mob's career, and jump-starting Dennis' career as a solo artist.\n\nThe song appeared in the film She-Devil, which starred Meryl Streep and Roseanne Barr.\n\nD Mob (or D-Mob) is one of the stage names used by British house music producer Dancin' Danny D (born Daniel Kojo Poku).\n\nThe 1988 UK hit &quot;We Call It Acieed&quot; hit #3 in the UK Singles Chart, and was one of a wave of acid house singles to enjoy success that year. D Mob went on to have a further three Top Twenty singles in the UK during 1989 and 1990, which were &quot;It is Time to Get Funky&quot;, which reached #9, &quot;C'mon and Get My Love&quot;, which reached #15, and &quot;Put Your Hands Together&quot;, which reached #7.\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s D Mob charted five songs on the U.S. Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart, four of which went to #1, including &quot;We Call It Acieed&quot;, &quot;It's Time To Get Funky&quot;, &quot;C'mon and Get My Love&quot; (with Cathy Dennis), and &quot;That's The Way Of The World&quot; (also with Dennis). In the U.S. they are best known for the hit &quot;C'mon and Get My Love&quot;, a song featuring vocalist Cathy Dennis, that crossed over to pop radio and hit #10 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1990.\n\nAside from Dennis, Danny D has collaborated with vocalists Gary Haisman and LRS.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8cd2cf7fc3708cba09d4e8687b6e7cac87d8cd0d","amp;dn":"D-Mob+-+C%5C%27mon+and+Get+My+Love++%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8cd2cf7fc3708cba09d4e8687b6e7cac87d8cd0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,210,207,127,195,112,140,186,9,212,232,104,123,110,124,172,135,216,205,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
