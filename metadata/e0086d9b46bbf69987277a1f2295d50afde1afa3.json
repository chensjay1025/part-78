It is a retrospective of the band's two performances on Austin City Limits in 1983 and 1989. Tracks 1-3 were recorded on December 13, 1983. Tracks 4-9 recorded October 10, 1989. Few guitarists ever mastered the Fender Stratocaster like the late, great Texas bluesman Stevie Ray Vaughan, and this priceless digital video disc collects both of the sizzling appearances that Vaughan and his solid band, Double Trouble, made on the PBS concert series Austin City Limits. Combined to form the most popular program in the show's distinguished history, the concerts were taped in 1983 and 1989; both provide a valuable portrait of Vaughan's astounding artistic development. The performances serve as bookends to Vaughan's brilliant career with Double Trouble, showing (in the words of producer Terry Lickona) a striking contrast between &quot;zero self-confidence&quot; and &quot;pure magic,&quot; but in both cases you can see a master at work. Songs include &quot;Pride and Joy,&quot; &quot;Texas Flood,&quot; &quot;Voodoo Chile,&quot; &quot;Cold Shot,&quot; and &quot;Riviera Paradise.&quot; This great-sounding DVD also includes the posthumous music video &quot;Little Wing,&quot; featuring clips of Double Trouble and archival footage of blues greats from the 1920s to the mid-1990s. If you're even a part-time blues fan, Stevie Ray Vaughan: Live from Austin, Texas is a must-have disc.\n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://freemusic07.ucoz.com/StoreF/Stevie_Ray_Vaughan-1983-89-Live_from_Austin_City_L.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://freemusic07.ucoz.com/StoreF/Stevie_Ray_Vaughan-1983-89-Live_from_Austin_City_L.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: TrackList :.\n\n01 - Program Start\n02 - Pride And Joy\n03 - Texas Flood\n04 - Voodoo Chile\n05 - The House Is Rockin'\n06 - Tightrope\n07 - Leave My Girl Alone\n08 - Cold Shot\n09 - Crossfire\n10 - Riviera Paradise\n11 - Tick Tock\n12 - Little Wing (bonus video)\n\n.: Crediti :.\n\nAnno: October 31, 1995\nProducer: Gary Menotti\nDirector: Bill Arhos, Terry Lickona\n\nStar: Jimmie Vaughan (Guitar, Vocals)\nTommy Shannon (Bass) (as Double Trouble)\nChris Layton (Drums) (as Double Trouble)\n\n.: Screenshot :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img838.imageshack.us/img838/8828/3qwm.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img838.imageshack.us/img838/8828/3qwm.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n========================================\n\n.: Dati tecnici del file :.\n\nSOURCE : Copy DVD (shrinking size unknown)\nRIPPED : with Slysoft CloneDVD Mobile 1.2.0.1 in combination with Slysoft AnyDVD\nQUALITY: Maximum\nOUTPUT : PSP format 364x272 (AVC/H264) mp4\nAUDIO : AAC 2 channel (stereo), Sample rate 48000 Hz, Bitrate 1536 Kb/s\nSIZE : 386MB\nINFO : PSP firmware 3.30","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0086d9b46bbf69987277a1f2295d50afde1afa3","amp;dn":"Stevie+Ray+Vaughan+-+Live+From+Austin+Texas+and+Extra+%5BDVDrip%5D+T","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0086d9b46bbf69987277a1f2295d50afde1afa3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,8,109,155,70,187,246,153,135,39,122,31,34,149,213,10,253,225,175,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
