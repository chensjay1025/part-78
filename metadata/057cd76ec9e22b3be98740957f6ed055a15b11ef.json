But the former lovers are now middle aged business partners trying to get with it and make a success of their vodka and veggie cyber cafe. \n\nGetting Nowhere Fast centres around the relationship between Pam and Merv. They run a cafe together and despite the fact that Pam has seemingly moved on in her life, she has re-married and left behind her free spirited days of love-ins and protesting for a better world with Merv there is obviously a part of her that still finds Merve optimism alluring.\n\nShe has a rich, albeit absent husband, yet yearns for the wild abandon that she and Merv once shared. Of course she would never admit this to Merv. The cafÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© symbolises their relationship: a thing of the past that is in desperate need of being brought up to date and re-assessed. Hence their decision to try to attract a new breed of customers who are conversant with cyber technology. \n\nThe cafe has a rather eclectic mix of regulars, from Dibden - the retired thespian who, much to the chagrin of those around him, quite literally believes all the worlds a stage - to Neville, possibly the most unstreetwise 28 year old you are likely to meet.\n\n\nThe Cast:  \nMervyn Stutter\nLill Roughley\nJohn Challis\nChris Ettridge\nGyuri Sarossi\nGeoffrey McGivern\n\n\nGetting Nowhere Fast - S01 - E01 - Up The Cyber Pass\nGetting Nowhere Fast - S01 - E02 - Friday Night Is Vinyl Night\nGetting Nowhere Fast - S01 - E03 - Love Bytes\nGetting Nowhere Fast - S01 - E04 - Up On The Roof\n\nGetting Nowhere Fast - S02 - E01\nGetting Nowhere Fast - S02 - E02\nGetting Nowhere Fast - S02 - E03\nGetting Nowhere Fast - S02 - E04\n\nGetting Nowhere Fast - S03 - E01\nGetting Nowhere Fast - S03 - E02\nGetting Nowhere Fast - S03 - E03\nGetting Nowhere Fast - S03 - E04\nGetting Nowhere Fast - S03 - E05\nGetting Nowhere Fast - S03 - E06\n\n\n\nAudio Format    : MP3\nDuration Approx : 28mn 54s\nBit rate mode   : Constant\nBit rate        : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)      : 2 channels\nSampling rate   : 44.1 KHz\nResolution      : 16 bits\n\n\n[","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:057cd76ec9e22b3be98740957f6ed055a15b11ef","amp;dn":"Getting+Nowhere+Fast+-+S01+to+03+-+Audio+Comedy+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"057cd76ec9e22b3be98740957f6ed055a15b11ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,124,215,110,201,226,43,59,233,135,64,149,127,110,208,85,161,91,17,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
