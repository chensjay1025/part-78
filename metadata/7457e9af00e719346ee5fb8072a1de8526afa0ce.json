It was not until 2002 that the band released their self-titled debut full-length studio album though. The band at that time consisted of Joe Booe on lead vocals, Chris M Jacobson on guitars and vocals, Garegin &quot;Greg&quot; Kalajian on keyboards and vocals, Shawn &quot;The Dude&quot; Richkind on bass and Barry Magnuson on drums and percussion. Lead vocalist Joe Booe was replaced by Danny Veras before the recording of the second full-length studio album &quot;In Time&quot; which was released in 2009.\n\n01. New Age\n02. Change\n03.
