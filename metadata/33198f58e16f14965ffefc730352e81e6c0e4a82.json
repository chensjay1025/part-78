The control is exactly as you'd expect: virtual d-pad, touch-and-drag to move camera, fire/reload buttons, and so on. You'll manage limited ammo and health restorers while exploring creepy locales where evil is clearly resident. Used to shaking your controller when a zombie gets ahold of you? No worries, as you can also shake your iPhone to push them off. Your guns (rifle, shotgun, grenade launcher) all feature a laser sight to help you get that headshot in.
