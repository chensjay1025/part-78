There is no glorification of gambling as it is exposed for what it is and does--damages the lives of those who gamble and of those around them....This is probably one of the best all-round teaching and therapy tools available on the market today. The price is quite affordable considering the excellent content and information. I highly recommend this DVD to anyone looking for a realistic, unbiased overview of problem gambling. This should be mandatory viewing for parents with their teenage and college-aged children....4 stars! ----Doody's Review Service\n\nProduct Description\nThis straight-talking, empowering video program offers essential information on how problem gambling develops, its damaging impact on individuals and families, and how it can successfully be treated. Through candid first-hand accounts from four recovering gamblers, along with illuminating commentary from mental health experts, the program shows gamblers, their families, and therapists: how an alluring diversion becomes a shameful secret as problem gambling takes hold; common myths and misperceptions about gambling--and why 'winning big' is so unlikely; the benefits of individual and group therapy and self-help approaches; and ways to overcome setbacks in recovery and make meaningful, lasting changes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:444ab94a0562e9a300397935a51dcc5cb8bc623f","amp;dn":"Overcoming+Problem+Gambling+%28Self+Help+Video%29+%5BDVDRip%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"444ab94a0562e9a300397935a51dcc5cb8bc623f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,74,185,74,5,98,233,163,0,57,121,53,165,29,204,92,184,188,98,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
