Mission Solved, Problem Accomplished\n\n\nRebuke are releasing their second album ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“WouldworksÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ on Kickass Records (Belgium) and Disconnect Disconnect Records (UK), having honed their punk/hardcore crossover sound into fourteen killer new tracks. On top of it all the album features Simone Perini playing the drums, known from touring and playing with bands such as Actionmen and This is a Standoff.\n\nHailing from Gothenburg, Sweden, the boys have been playing together since 2003, building up a strong European following thanks to their unshakeable work ethic; self-releasing their songs and touring non-stop.\n\nTaking influence from the SoCal punk scene, with Bad Religion, NOFX, Propagandhi and all offering musical inspiration, Rebuke challenge their influences by interjecting some metal elements into their fast-paced punk. Singing about a mix of political or personal issues, Rebuke keep their lyrical subject matter smart enough to get you thinking, and catchy enough to sing along to.\n\n2010's set to be a busy year for the band as they tour hard to support ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“WouldworksÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ catch them live in Europe!\n\nURLs:\n\nOfficial Website..........http://www.rebukepunks.com\nOfficial Webstore.........http://rebuke.bigcartel.com\nPurevolume-page...........http://www.purevolume.com/rebuke\nLastFM....................http://www.last.fm/music/rebuke\nBandCamp..................http://rebuke.bandcamp.com/\nInterpunk.................http://www.interpunk.com/search.cfm?&amp;searchfor=Rebuke\niTunes....................http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewArtist?id=306827927\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3f90c44f47fe0b5238e2de84c7babd94f23a31e","amp;dn":"Rebuke+-+Wouldworks+%5B2010%5D-MTD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3f90c44f47fe0b5238e2de84c7babd94f23a31e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,249,12,68,244,127,224,181,35,142,45,232,76,123,171,217,79,35,163,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
