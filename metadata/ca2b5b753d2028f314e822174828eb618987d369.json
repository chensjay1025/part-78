Searchable pdf (clearscan) with contents in bookmarks, accurate pagination and metadata, etc.\n\n\nA medieval spiritual classic on the meaning of friendship in Christian life.\n\ndescription:\n\nThroughout his life, Aelred took great joy in his friends and he believed that by loving and being loved by them, we learn to accept and return God's infinitely greater and enduring love. Real friendship always includes a third person, the Lord Jesus.\n\nReview\n\n'There is much to be admired in Aelred's work: the glimpse into his heart, the realistic descriptions of situations and human behavior, the still-valid psychological insights and practical counsels, the balanced view of man's nature, and, in some instances, a delightful sense of humor combined with occasional teasing' -- Church History\n\n\nabout the author (adapted from wikipedia):\n\nAelred (1110 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 12 January 1167), was an English writer, abbot of the Cistercian monastic community of Rievaulx Abbey (from 1147 until his death), and saint.\n\nAelred wrote several influential books on spirituality, among them Speculum caritatis (&quot;The Mirror of Charity,&quot; reportedly written at the request of Bernard of Clairvaux) and De spiritali amicitia (&quot;On Spiritual Friendship&quot;). He also wrote seven works of history, addressing three of them to Henry II of England, advising him how to be a good king and declaring him to be the true descendent of Anglo-Saxon kings. \n\nAelred died on January 12, 1167, at Rievaulx. He is thought to have suffered from the stone (hence his patronage) and arthritis in his later years. He is listed for January 12 in the Roman Martyrology and the calendars of various churches. He was canonized in 1191.\n\nSeveral gay-friendly organizations have adopted Aelred as their patron saint, such as Integrity in the Episcopal Church in the United States of America, National Anglican Catholic Church in the northeast United States, and the Order of St. Aelred.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca2b5b753d2028f314e822174828eb618987d369","amp;dn":"Aelred+of+Rievaulx+-+Spiritual+Friendship+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca2b5b753d2028f314e822174828eb618987d369","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,43,91,117,61,32,40,243,20,232,34,23,72,40,235,97,137,135,211,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
