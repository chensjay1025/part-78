Included in this bundle, is a demo that they recorded in 1998. The demo was scheduled to be released as an album, after the band's breakup, under the title PRESCRIPTION FOR LUNACY. It was never officially released, but a few copies were leaked.\n\nMonopoly lineup:\n\nShawn Murphy:  vocals\nBryce Bernius: lead guitar, backing vocals\nDave Kamrath:  drums\nPat Parnel:    bass\n\nAmerica's Greatest Zeros lineup:\n\nShawn Murphy:  vocals\nBryce Bernius: lead guitar, backing vocals\nDave Kamrath:  drums, backing vocals\nPat Parnel:    bass, backing vocals\nKaz:           guitar\n\nPrescription for Lunacy lineup:\n\n\nShawn Murphy:  vocals\nBryce Bernius: lead guitar, backing vocals\nDave Kamrath:  drums\nPat Parnel:    bass\nKaz:           guitar\n\nIn 1999, lead guitarist Bryce Bernius left the band to join THE UNDEAD (with former members of the original Misfits), and was replaced by Josh Starry. The band failed to produce anymore albums, since they no longer had Bernius (a key songwriter in the band).\nThey disbanded in 2000. \n\nNo more albums were released by them, although sometime toward the end of their run, a California based band appeared, who began using the same name. The two bands do not appear to be related in any way, other than the fact that they are both punk bands from the US. \n\nThe FL based MadCap would later do a short reunion tour, with the following lineup:\n\nShawn Murphy:  vocals\nBryce Bernius: lead guitar\nJordan Young:  drums\nPat Parnel:    bass\nJosh Starry:   guitar\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd77ca726aa2e24922d7f75a7a517d014d4012f0","amp;dn":"MADCAP+discography+%28punk+rock%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd77ca726aa2e24922d7f75a7a517d014d4012f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,119,202,114,106,162,226,73,34,215,247,90,122,81,125,1,77,64,18,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
