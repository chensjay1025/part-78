The US military recently arrested Army Specialist Bradley Manning, who may have passed on the video to Wikileaks. The arrest of Bradley Manning and the hunt for Assange has put the spotlight on the Obama administrationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s campaign against whistleblowers and leakers of classified information. We speak to Daniel Ellsberg, whoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s leaking of the Pentagon Papers has made him perhaps the nationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most famous whistleblower; Birgitta Jonsdottir, a member of the Icelandic Parliament who has collaborated with WikiLeaks and drafted a new Icelandic law protecting investigative journalists; and Glenn Greenwald, political and legal blogger for Salon.com.\n\n\n- Jeremy Scahill on Blackwater Owner Erik PrinceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Rumored Move to UAE and Obama AdminÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Expansion of Special Forces Operations Abroad\n\nThe Justice department has told a federal appeals court there was more than enough untainted evidence to justify a trial for the five Blackwater Worldwide guards involved in the 2007 Nissour Square massacre in Baghdad. In court papers seeking to reinstate criminal charges that were dismissed last year, the Justice department said the judge \n\n&quot;unjustifiably drew the curtain on a meritorious prosecution.&quot; This legal development comes amidst a report that Erik Prince, the owner and founder of the the notorious private security firm, could be planing a move to the United Arab Emirates, a country that has no extradition treaty with the United States. We speak to independent journalist Jeremy Scahill.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:175404db42e0fcd325eade4ffaada0ef261dca0e","amp;dn":"Democracy+Now+-+17+jun+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"175404db42e0fcd325eade4ffaada0ef261dca0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,84,4,219,66,224,252,211,37,234,222,79,250,173,160,239,38,29,202,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
