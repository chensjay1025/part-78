Deleting a file normally just removes the file's directory entry, but the data itself remains on the disk. This program completely eliminates the contents of deleted files. The highly acclaimed Gutmann disk cleaning method is now available as an option. This program can also clean the Window's swap file, and can optionally clean unneeded temporary files from your hard disk, such as your Internet browser cache, files in your system's Recycle Bin, and can clear the &quot;recent files&quot; list. Comes with a direct disk viewer for discovering exactly what is on your hard disk.\n\nFeatures:\n=========\n\n- Secure file deletion.\n- Make already-deleted files unrecoverable. Clean free disk space.\n- Wipe Internet browser cache, browsing history, and cookies (from Internet Explorer, Firefox, etc).\n- Wipe lists of names of recently used files, URLs, and email addresses.\n- Wipe the Windows swap file.\n- Hundreds of plugins included to wipe the tracks of hundreds of different applications, such as Windows Media Player, Emule, Paintshop, etc.\n- Removes unneeded temporary files, releasing more disk space.\n- Special support for Firefox and Windows Vista.\n- Create your own plugins to clean anything you like using the accompanying Plugin Editor.\n- Direct Disk Viewer so you can see exactly what is on your disk.\n\n\n\n=================================================================\n\n\nFor anyone WHO MAY HAVE issues with installation, extraction, wrong file extensions, passwords etc for this or any of my other installer torrents.

Return to your downloaded installer torrent of mine and change the file extension to .exe\n\nThen right click on it and select &quot;Run as administrator&quot;. \n\nNONE of my torrents are, or ever have been passworded or have any other type of security, re-directs etc on them.\n\n\n=================================================================\n\n\n-nelly- home page at The Pirate Bay link below:\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/-nelly-/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/-nelly-/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nCheck out the new PirateWiki!\n\n           &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/wiki/index.php?title=Portal:Main_Page&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/wiki/index.php?title=Portal:Main_Page&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFor re-seed requests, help, support or anything else relating to The Pirate Bay.
