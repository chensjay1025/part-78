One week after the U.S. government issued a vague &quot;terror alert&quot; around the world, we learned that multiple agencies would perform &quot;terrorism response&quot; drills in Austin, Texas starting this weekend. David and Alex discuss a law enforcement document provided recently to Infowars which identified Austin as a &quot;target for terror.&quot; Infowars reporter Lee Ann McAdoo hits the streets of Austin to talk to people about their awareness and opinions of the planned drills. A released FBI document shows that the agency is creating a real crime wave in America -- sanctioning violence, political corruption and drug trafficking -- all of which would be considered illegal if not blessed by the FBI.\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential \n to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a\n spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the &quot;big \n picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media \n for news and info is a prescription for ignorance.
