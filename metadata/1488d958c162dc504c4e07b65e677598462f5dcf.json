If you are a Bach fan, however, I tell you the music is so fantastic that it alone would be certainly worth your while.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1488d958c162dc504c4e07b65e677598462f5dcf","amp;dn":"Die+Martins+Passion+-+Joao+Carlos+Martins","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1488d958c162dc504c4e07b65e677598462f5dcf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,136,217,88,193,98,220,80,76,78,7,182,94,103,117,152,70,47,93,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
