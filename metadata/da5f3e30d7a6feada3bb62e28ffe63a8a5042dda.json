Most of my torrents include this info, but finding the software and knowing how to do it is also hard. For one thing, the tagging software I use hasn't been worked on for more than three years, and it's hard to find.\n\nAlso, I only know of two other people who know how to convert using the method I use, and only one of them has ever uploaded films and TV shows in this format (HolyRoses), and he isn't really doing 853x conversions anymore, focusing more on AppleTV conversions and PSP-compatible video conversions.\n\nSo, I've included the following in this torrent:\n1. TVTagger (folder)\n- The software I use to do about 90% of my tagging. I use iTunes for the rest. You need Java to run this program.\n2. AtomicParsley\n- Part of TVTagger, but also what I use to add the 5G UUID iPod Atom for 5G &amp; 5.5G iPod Compatibility.\n3. FFmpeg\n- Most basic and common MPEG-4 video transcoder, I use it in a command line capacity, which I explain in the .NFO file included.\n4. DVDDecryptor\n- The greatest DVD Ripping software ever.\n5. AnyDVD (v6.4.6.9 -- Cracked)\n- Makes DVD Ripping so much easier -- no copywrite protection!\n6. Batch files and NFO files\n- Basically just files showing how I do batch encoding with FFmpeg.\n\n\nI'm going to try and seed this until it's well seeded. For those FANS of my torrents, if you'd please keep this as a 'forced seed' when you download it, but then limit the upload speed to a crawl, it's not very big, but I'd like to be able to have it stay seeded for a long time without being a drain on anyone's bandwidth.\n\nThanks!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da5f3e30d7a6feada3bb62e28ffe63a8a5042dda","amp;dn":"VoV+iPod+%2F+Portable+Video+Conversion+%26+Tagging+Software","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da5f3e30d7a6feada3bb62e28ffe63a8a5042dda","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,95,62,48,215,166,254,173,163,187,98,226,143,254,99,168,165,4,45,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
