Episode: Brown Betty\nAccording to the scene groups and a couple of misinformed websites, this is S02E20. For anyone who actually watched the Jan. 11th airing and looked up the truth, we know this is wrong.\n\nInitial speed will be slow, please help seed if you can, thanks.\n\nCompatible With DivX DVD Players (720x400 Resolution).\n\nMethod used:\nVirtualDub MKV Plugin:\nLanczos3 Resize Filter and Saved uncompressed @ 50GB\nCompressed With DivX 2-Pass @ &quot;Insane Quality&quot; Setting\nResolution: 720x400\nBitrate: 1999\nAudio: AC3 ACM 5.1 Channel @ 256kbps @ 48,000hz\n\nNote: I switched resizing from the encoding step to the uncompression step, which made it possible to use the better Lanczos3 resize filter. I wasn't resizing first since it cuts the uncompressed data by just over 100GB. Which to me, didn't sound good, but I think it actually does look better.\n\nSo feel free to let me know how you think it compares to my previous rips.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c964320b801462c3d4e2c291fb4a63d723b44247","amp;dn":"Fringe+S02E19+HQ+HDTV+AC3+DivX+%28aka+S02E20+Re-Encode+From+720p%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c964320b801462c3d4e2c291fb4a63d723b44247","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,100,50,11,128,20,98,195,212,226,194,145,251,74,99,215,35,180,66,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
