There, the world's greatest surgeon, Naomitsu Madaraki, once lived. But he hasn't come home in ages.\nInstead, the professor's &quot;daughter&quot;, Fran Madaraki, lives there with a large amount of her own ghoulish creations and her &quot;younger sister&quot; Veronica. She's a very unusual girl, what with the stitch patterns on her face and the giant bolts on either side of her head. She's also just as skilled at surgery as her father, and if you're willing to pay her price, she can do everything up to and including raising the dead.\nFran believes that a life should be saved no matter the cost, and keep that in mind, since the results of her surgeries are rarely (if ever) pretty.\n\n\n\n\nGa Rei\n\n\nWhile many of us would probably scream at even the thought of a ghost being near us, Freshman Nimura Kensuke just thinks of it as a common everyday thing, seeing as how he has the uncanny ability to see so many of them on a daily basis.
