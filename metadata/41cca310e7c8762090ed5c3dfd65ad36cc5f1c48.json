Seagle and superstar artist Tim Sale!\n\nThe Amazon Jungle is among the most ancient and biologically diverse places on earth, but it's being plundered for its resources and destroyed at a rate of thousands of acres a day. Reporter Malcolm Hillard travels to this remote land of mystery to investigate the disappearance of an American worker and sabotage at a timber site. Locals tell him it is the work of spirits of the Amazon, but Malcolm doesn't believe in anything like that -- until he sees something he can't explain deep in the jungle.\n\n\n** If you have any question please feel free to ask! **\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41cca310e7c8762090ed5c3dfd65ad36cc5f1c48","amp;dn":"The+Amazon+%282009%29+%28%231-3%29+%5BComplete%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41cca310e7c8762090ed5c3dfd65ad36cc5f1c48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,204,163,16,231,200,118,32,144,237,92,61,253,101,173,54,204,95,28,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
