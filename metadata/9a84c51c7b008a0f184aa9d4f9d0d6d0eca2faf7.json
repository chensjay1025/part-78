After this album, singer &quot;Dizzy&quot; Dean Davidson left the group and formed the band Blackeyed Susan. He was replaced in Britny Fox by singer Tommy Paris. The album debuted at #79 on the billboard charts.\n\nBritny Fox is an American  glam metal band from the Philadelphia  area, initially active from 1985 to 1992 then subsequently reforming in 2001. They are best known for their music video for &quot;Girlschool&quot; (U.S. #81) and their hit &quot;Long Way to Love&quot; (U.S. #100).\n\nBritny Fox formed in 1985 in Philadelphia. The band was originally fronted by lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist &quot;Dizzy&quot; Dean Davidson.\n\nThe band released a demo titled In America in 1986, which drummer Tony Destra reportedly played on. The band's self-titled debut album, released in 1988, was one of the most successful premieres of the 1988-89 season, selling more than one million copies and bringing more than 625,000 fans to their 130+ shows. They also won Metal Edge Magazine's 1988 Reader's Choice Award for Best New Band. After the release of the band's second album in 1989, Boys in Heat, Davidson departed, and formed the band Blackeyed Susan. He was replaced by Las Vegas native Tommy Paris aka Don Jillson formerly of the band Jillson. Ozzy Osbourne guitarist Zakk Wylde and Poison drummer Rikki Rockett guested on the band's third album, Bite Down Hard, which was released in 1991. However, the popularity of glam metal was on a decline around the time of the album's release due to the rising popularity of the grunge movement. Britny Fox disbanded in 1992.\n\nMichael Kelly Smith was previously in an early version of fellow Philadelphia glam metal band Cinderella until his dismissal, and later Tony Destra also played with them.\n\nDrummer Adam West, formerly of Tangier, played for Britny Fox briefly between the time of Tony Destra and Johnny Dee.\n\nBritny Fox reunited in 2001 with the same line up before their disbandment, and released a fourth studio album, Springhead Motorshark, in 2003. The band has had summer US and European tours in 2007 and 2008. Guitarist Tommy Krash and former White Lion drummer Greg D'Angelo was supposed to join at that time, but he broke his foot during rehearsal and was replaced with Henry Now.\n\nAs of 2007, Britny Fox reformed under original bassist Billy Childs. The other current members are lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Jamie Fletcher, lead guitarist Greg Polcari, and drummer Henry Now.\n\nBassist Billy Childs has signed on to appear in the upcoming horror film &quot;Incest Death Squad&quot; scheduled for release in late 2010.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a84c51c7b008a0f184aa9d4f9d0d6d0eca2faf7","amp;dn":"Britny+Fox+-+Dream+On++%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a84c51c7b008a0f184aa9d4f9d0d6d0eca2faf7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,132,197,28,123,0,138,15,24,74,169,212,249,208,214,208,236,162,250,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
