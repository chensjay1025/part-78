This one looks back at twenty\nyears in the life of the Conway family - 1919 to 1939.\n\nIt seems to me that Priestley's obsession with time has its\nroots in the same place as Kurt Vonnegut's. Dislocation from\nwitnessing events so extreme as to be near impossible to believe. \n\nI draw this comparison because, even though the WWI battles\nwent on for weeks and months, their huge body counts happened\nin hours. Vonnegut went to bed in a packed ornate city. He\nwoke to a pile of ash. Priestley saw hundreds of his Bradford\nboyhood contemporaries die in a couple of doomed attacks in\nSeptember, 1915. In 1917 he witnessed the first day of a Somme\nOffensive that killed 60,000 allies before lunchtime.\n\nEver after, when Priestley thought about his youth, he saw\n&quot; ... a crowd of ghosts ...&quot;. No wonder it was 1962 before\nhe could write about the war.\n\nCast\nMarcia Warren\nBelinda Sinclair\nStella Gonny\nJohn Detine\nToby Stevens\nAmanda Redman\nEmma Fielding\nJohn McCargle\nJulia Hills\nChristopher Scott\nSharon Wilmott\nMalcolm McKee\n.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:143a9385816d20ac52c2bf23c8a885fc84bace79","amp;dn":"BBC+R4+-+J+B+Priestley%5C%27s+%5C%27Time+And+The+Conways%5C%27+sp7","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"143a9385816d20ac52c2bf23c8a885fc84bace79","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,58,147,133,129,109,32,172,82,194,191,35,200,168,133,252,132,186,206,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
