He has three sons: Sam (Sampat) and Vicky (Rajiv) from his first wife, and Shiva (Ajith) from his second wife. JeevanandhamÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s favourite is Shiva, who is gutsy and righteous, while the other two are immature and controlled by their uncle, the evil Kali Mamma (Pradeep Rawat), and will do any shady deals.\n\nSarah (Sameera Reddy) is a cultural attachÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© at the Indian Embassy in Paris who has a soft spot for Shiva. There is a French police officer, Daniel (Suresh), who constantly hangs around with the family and is a partner in crime.\n\nThe bad sons want to deal in drugs and supply arms to terrorists; they work out a strategy to eliminate Shetty (Keli Dorji), who controls the Mumbai underworld, but the old man and Shiva oppose it. After the old man's death, Vicky is kidnapped by Shetty and his gang, who brutally torture him.\n\nTo save Vicky, Shiva goes to Mumbai. His local contact there is Mirasi (Prabhu), his fatherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s best friend. A local girl, Sulaba (Bhavana), falls for our hero, who daringly rescues Vicky with the joker Don Samosa (Yuhi Sethu). But the brothers double-cross Shiva and dump him in a river. How the protagonist takes vengeance against those who betrayed him forms the rest of the story.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc5766021429d20d9fbbf1338b0e7a6a58f1aaef","amp;dn":"Aasal%282010%29+X264+350MB+LOTUS+DVDRip.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc5766021429d20d9fbbf1338b0e7a6a58f1aaef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,87,102,2,20,41,210,13,159,187,241,51,139,14,122,106,88,241,170,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
