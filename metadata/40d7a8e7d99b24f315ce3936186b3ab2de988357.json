Williams is a throwback to the classic Chicago blues piano style, and his warm, expressive vocals fall somewhere between a hoarse Ray Charles and a latter-day Bob Dylan, while his songwriting, although hardly innovative, is solid and workmanlike, avoiding most of the obvious blues clichÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s. His intent isn't to move blues into the 21st century so much as preserve the way it was played in Chicago in the 1950s (where Williams played alongside the likes of Jimmy Reed, Eddie Boyd, Eddie Taylor, and Little Mack Simmons), and he succeeds wonderfully on original tracks here like his signature tune, &quot;Call My Job,&quot; &quot;Money Crazy,&quot; and &quot;Somebody Better Do Something,&quot; as well as a nice cover of Lowell Fulson's &quot;Rockin' After Midnight.&quot; \nFans of vintage Chicago blues piano will find this collection a delight\n\n1.
