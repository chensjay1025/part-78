The demon is Balthazor, a good-natured, low-level torturer who has amassed an encyclopedic knowledge of the human condition thanks to his love of classic TV sitcoms.\n\nBalathazor and his family head to earth with one mission: to blend in with the humans and figure out how to destroy the drill, thus protecting Hell. More accustomed to life in the nether regions, the Hellmans try to follow the rule of SNORFIN--&quot;seem normal and fit in&quot;--but they quickly learn that humans can be more evil than any demon ever could.\n\nSoon, the Hellmans discover that their demonic natures are no match for the twisted ways of their earthly counterparts...\n\nThe Hellman family is sent to Earth's surface to save hell from human beings.\n\n*** 2-pass 272p encodings for computers (PC, Mac), PS3 or Xbox, portable and mobile devices (Ipod, Itouch) . ***\n*** Video is 480x272 H264; audio is 44.1 kHz/stereo AAC LC and container is MP4. ***\n\n&quot;Home&quot; of my torrents (for Bookmark/Favorites in your browser) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/twentyforty&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/twentyforty&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSCHEDULE for this week (and NO more requests):\n\nMonday:  Tudors, Treme as 272p H264;\n         Breaking Bad as 720p\nTuesday: Lie to Me as 272p H264\nWednesday: Glee, Justified as 272p H264;\nThursday: Happy Town as 720p H264\nFriday:\nSaturday: Gravity as 272p H264;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:165448629a492e285ca1cb112913b261e65a853b","amp;dn":"Neighbors.From.Hell.S01E01.272p.HDTV.H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"165448629a492e285ca1cb112913b261e65a853b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,84,72,98,154,73,46,40,92,161,203,17,41,19,178,97,230,90,133,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
