Is this strange invasion an anomaly or is this sleek and powerful predator a messenger of change, a herald of even more frightening pan-oceanic changes to come?\n\nBoarding the research vessel Elahka , the film then heads out to the sea with fishermen and scientists to discover why thousands of creatures have suddenly disappeared in the deep ocean off Oregon. Is there a toxin in the water? Or is a fundamental change occurring in the global ocean ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a change that may transform bountiful ecosystems into oxygen-starved killing zones?\n\nNext, we cruise the stunning coral reefs of Florida and the rugged coastal waters of the sub-Arctic, where scientists are hard at work above the water and below the surface. Their goal? To investigate how increasingly corrosive waters may be threatening some of the most important creatures in the ocean and one of its most diverse and beautiful ecosystems.\nStrange Days are Dawning\n\nStrange days are dawning in the global sea. Creatures are on the move. Dead zones are expanding. The foundation of life is slowly eroding. And we are the agents of that change.\n\nOver the past 200 years, human beings have poured more than two trillion metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. And as The Changing Sea vividly illustrates, that carbon dioxide isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t just changing the climate on land. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s transforming the ocean in ways that havenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t been seen for millions of years.\n\nSo is mass extinction the inevitable fate of the future sea?  In the waters near a still active Mediterranean volcano, this compelling documentary shows us what the future ocean may look like, if we donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t take action now.\n\nAn ode to the power and beauty of the ocean, a warning of all that may be lost if we continue with business as usual, The Changing Sea asks us all one compelling question ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ are we willing to form a new partnership with the ocean and itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s astonishing creatures? If not, then our future and the future of thousands of other species may hang in the balance.\n\nThe series One Ocean is produced by CBCÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the nature of things and Merit Motion Pictures in association with National Geographic Channels International. The Changing Sea is written and directed by Erna Buffie, and produced by Sandra Moore and Merit Jensen Carr. The Executive Producer is Merit Jensen Carr.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7607f24748accb1f695fdecf652dd74eab6b3ec7","amp;dn":"One+Ocean+Episode+4+-+The+Changing+Sea++-+The+Nature+of+things20","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7607f24748accb1f695fdecf652dd74eab6b3ec7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,7,242,71,72,172,203,31,105,95,222,207,101,45,215,78,171,107,62,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
