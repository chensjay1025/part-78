So you can spend less time sorting and refining photographs, and more time actually shooting them. Its clean, elegant interface literally steps out of the way and lets you quickly view and work with the images you shot today, as well as the thousands of images that you will shoot over the course of your career. Because no two photographers work alike, AdobeLightroom adapts to your workflow, not the other way around.\n\nLightroom lets you view, zoom in, and compare photographs quickly and easily. Precise, photography-specific adjustments allow you to fine tune your images while maintaining the highest level of image quality from capture through output. And best of all, it runs on most commonly used computers, even notebook computers used on location. New AdobeÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® PhotoshopÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® LightroomÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 2 helps you sort and find the photos you want faster, target specific photo areas for more precise adjustments, and showcase your talent using more flexible printing templates. A host of other new features and enhancements make Lightroom 2 an essential upgrade for professional photographers. \n\nOrganize Effortlessly\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Automatically organize photos using Smart Collections\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Work with high-quality previews of offline images from multiple libraries and drives\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Automatically import and process high-volume shoots\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Use custom keywords to organize photos Enhanced\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Automatically rename files on import and convert to universal Digital Negative (DNG) format\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Manage photos and volumes even when they're offline\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Quickly find any photo with powerful sorting and filtering\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Apply custom presets to images on import/export\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Access and edit a comprehensive set of metadata fields\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Browse groups, compare photos, and zoom in on details\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Create virtual copies of photos to save hard-disk space\n\nCorrect, Enhance, Edit\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Target specific areas of a photo for dodging and burning\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Expand your workspace across multiple monitors\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Enjoy state-of-the-art 64-bit memory handling\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Tightly integrate with Adobe Photoshop CS4\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Easily compare before and after versions of photos\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Precisely convert color to black and white\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Eliminate dust, specks, and red eye\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Retrace your editing steps to return to any version of a photo\n\nShowcase your talent\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Easily transfer images to popular photo-sharing sites\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Access a rich community of export plug-ins and web gallery styles at the Lightroom Exchange\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Print more efficiently with flexible and customizable templates\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Create web galleries with no coding required\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Sharpen photos when you output to print or the web\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Stamp your photos with metadata on output\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Compose sophisticated slide shows with music\n\nChanges in Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 2.7\n* Newly supported camera models include:\no Canon EOS 550D (Digital Rebel T2i/ EOS Kiss X4 Digital)\no Kodak Z981\no Leaf Aptus-II 8\no Leaf Aptus-II 10R\no Mamiya DM40\no Olympus E-PL1\no Panasonic G2\no Panasonic G10\no Sony A450","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84b7ead5e7b883afc6373c484e6bd0bc743cb567","amp;dn":"Adobe+Lightroom+2.7+Build+666138","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84b7ead5e7b883afc6373c484e6bd0bc743cb567","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,183,234,213,231,184,131,175,198,55,60,72,78,107,208,188,116,60,181,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
