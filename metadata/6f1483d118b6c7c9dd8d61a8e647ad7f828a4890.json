Since 2009, Keaton Snyder had joined the band as their vibraphone player.\n\n\nOriginally formed in 2006 as Dodobird by multi-instrumentalist Meric Long, unpredictable San Francisco indie rock duo the Dodos acquired their new moniker with the arrival of Logan Kroeber, a fellow West Coast artist whose penchant for experimental drumming and progressive metal melded perfectly with Long's interest in West African Ewe drumming and country blues fingerpicking. The Dodos released their debut album, Beware of the Maniacs, that same year independently, followed by Visiter in 2008. Long and Kroeber added electric vibraphonist Keaton Snyder to the fold and collaborated with producer Phil Ek on 2009's Time to Die, which found the trio exploring a more fleshed-out sound.\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01 Walking\n02 Red and Purple / Eyelids\n03 Fools\n04 Joe's Waltz\n05 Winter\n06 It's That Time Again\n07 Paint the Rust\n08 Jodi\n09 Ashley\n10 The Season\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\nLive album from this San Francisco folk-pop trio, recorded at Prague venue the Akropolis.\n\nRelease Date: Available now\nLabel: Self-released\n\n\n\n\nMedia:\n\nDownload the entire album in full at the Dodos' website (e-mail address required).
