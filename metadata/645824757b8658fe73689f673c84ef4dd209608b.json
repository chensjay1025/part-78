It was released March 17, 2009.\nDon't Forget is the first studio album of singer-songwriter Demi Lovato. It was released on September 23, 2008 in the United States by Hollywood Records, and it debuted at #2 on the Billboard 200. The album was released in the UK in April 2009 under Fascination Records.\nOn &quot;In Tune With Demi Lovato&quot;, a short, two-part special that aired on the Disney Channel, Lovato had stated that &quot;Don't Forget is one of the songs [on the album] that I relate to the most&quot; and that she loves it because she got to &quot;feel a lot of emotion while recording it&quot;. Lovato performed the song on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on April 15, 2009. The song is Demi's best-performing song so far from Don't Forget, peaking higher than the two previous singles. &quot;Trainwreck&quot; was supposed to be the third single from the album, but was replaced by &quot;Don't Forget&quot;.\n\nPlot\n\nThe video featured a more mature Lovato singing in the rain, and was praised by critics. The single's highest position on the Billboard Hot 100 was at #41. &quot;Don't Forget&quot; was the most successful single released by Lovato until it was succeeded by &quot;Here We Go Again&quot; by 26 spots charting at #15.\n\n\nSnapshots &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img94.imageshack.us/img94/4100/tforget1280x720avi00002.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img94.imageshack.us/img94/4100/tforget1280x720avi00002.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img189.imageshack.us/img189/6256/tforget1280x720avi00016.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img189.imageshack.us/img189/6256/tforget1280x720avi00016.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img34.imageshack.us/img34/6276/tforget1280x720avi00008.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img34.imageshack.us/img34/6276/tforget1280x720avi00008.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img12.imageshack.us/img12/5130/tforget1280x720avi00019.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img12.imageshack.us/img12/5130/tforget1280x720avi00019.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nDetails\n\nGeneral\n\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 134 MiB\nDuration                         : 4mn 5s\nOverall bit rate                 : 4 568 Kbps\n\nVideo\n\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nDuration                         : 4mn 5s\nBit rate                         : 4,435 Kbps\nWidth                            : 1,280 pixels\nHeight                           : 720 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16:9\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\nScan type                        : Progressive\nStream size                      : 130 MiB (97%)\n\nAudio\n\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nDuration                         : 4mn 5s\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 44.1 KHz\nResolution                       : 16 bits\nStream size                      : 3.75 MiB (3%)\nInterleave, duration             : 26 ms (0.63 video frame)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:645824757b8658fe73689f673c84ef4dd209608b","amp;dn":"Don%5C%27t+Forget+-+Demi+Lovato+%28HD+720p%29+%5Bmildpoison%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"645824757b8658fe73689f673c84ef4dd209608b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,88,36,117,123,134,88,254,115,104,159,103,60,132,239,77,210,9,96,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
