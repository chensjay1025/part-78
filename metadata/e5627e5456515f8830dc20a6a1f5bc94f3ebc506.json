Pulsating rythms, grinding staccoto riffing, thunderous low-end and Banshee screams are at the forefront of their sound. Twisting and grinding thru odd-time meters, devilish blast beats, and break-neck tempos are the main tools in the bands arsenal. Varying their attack with a shrill and intense live show the band truly captivates and hypnotizes their audience who leave the show with a &quot;bigger pair of balls.&quot; Heavily Lovecraftian influenced, the bands songs are are inspired from the unknown, dream psyche, mass murderers, addiction, and all other things DEATH METAL.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5627e5456515f8830dc20a6a1f5bc94f3ebc506","amp;dn":"Carrion+Remains+e.p.+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5627e5456515f8830dc20a6a1f5bc94f3ebc506","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,98,126,84,86,81,95,136,48,220,32,166,161,245,188,148,243,235,197,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
