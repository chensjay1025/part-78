Mr. Miyagi was going to let Daniel stay with him until he receives a letter from Okinawa telling him that his father is dying. So Miyagi leaves to go there and Daniel joins him. Miyagi tells Daniel that the reason he left Okinawa was because his best friend, Sato whose family is the most affluent in Okinawa, was promised Yukie whose the girl Miyagi loved. So Miyagi asks her to run away with him and when Sato learned of this, he challenged Miyagi to a fight to the death. So Miyagi left. Upon arriving Miyagi discovers Sato still wants to fight him and his nephew and best student Chozen has it out for Daniel.\n\n\nFormat : AVI\nFormat/Info : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size : 554 MiB\nDuration : 1h 48mn\nOverall bit rate : 713 Kbps\nWriting application : MEncoder SVN-r29352(20090610-gcc4.3.3)\nWriting library : MPlayer\n\nVideo\nFormat : avc1\nCodec ID : avc1\nDuration : 1h 48mn\nBit rate : 573 Kbps\nWidth : 480 pixels\nHeight : 360 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 4:3\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.133\nStream size : 445 MiB (80%)\n\nAudio\nID : 1\nFormat : MPEG Audio\nFormat version : Version 1\nFormat profile : Layer 3\nMode : Joint stereo\nFormat_Settings_ModeExtension : MS Stereo\nCodec ID : 55\nCodec ID/Hint : MP3\nDuration : 1h 48mn\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nStream size : 99.4 MiB (18%)\nAlignment : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration : 26 ms (0.65 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration : 522 ms\nWriting library : LAME3.98","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:837a1d9b2f145ba115672222df0d0a68f72065b9","amp;dn":"Karate+Kid+II%2C+The","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"837a1d9b2f145ba115672222df0d0a68f72065b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,122,29,155,47,20,91,161,21,103,34,34,223,13,10,104,247,32,101,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
