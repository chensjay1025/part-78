Any mail you receive about a potential Cataclysm beta is a scam.\n\n\n- you can create a goblin or worgen character, however, it crashes the client when trying to enter world\n- worgen female model is currently NOT implemented\n- when logging in with a character with the new class changes (e.g. tauren paladin) you will be dead and unable to type or do anything, but it allows you to enter world\n- there's a huge maelstrom-like change in STV that crashed my client when I went near it\n- Blasted Lands has to be a lil bugged (or at least for me) - dropped to 1 fps as soon as I entered it - and I have 100+ fps on all areas.\n\n\n1. Install Warcraft client enUS version only!\n2. Install Cataclysm Client.\n3. Edit the file c:/users/public/games/world of warcraft/data/enus/realmlist.wtf in notepad so it says: \n\nset realmlist 127.0.0.1\n\n4. Load the sandbox.exe\n5. Load game with wow.exe not launcher.exe and login with any username/password. Both must match though.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01ff23ef7d10a5f96aa3c541ae7890f7b3553e87","amp;dn":"World+of+Warcraft+Cataclysm+-+Friends+%26+Family+Alpha+Sandbox+1.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01ff23ef7d10a5f96aa3c541ae7890f7b3553e87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,255,35,239,125,16,165,249,106,163,197,65,174,120,144,247,179,85,62,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
