Two of the tracks are actually two songs in one.\nThe track listing listed here is as shown on a promo copy of the album.\nCodec: FLAC\n\nTracklisting:\n1 Herd Killing (2:36)\n2 Dead Cities (6:36)\n3 Her Face Forms In Summertime (5:39)\n4 We Have Explosive (6:19)\n5 Everyone In The World Is Doing Something Without Me (4:10)\n6 My Kingdom (5:46)\n7 Max (2:49)\n8 Antique Toy (5:43)\n9 Quagmire / In A State Of Permanent Abyss (6:58)\n10 Glass (5:38)\n11 Yage (7:32)\n12 Vit Drowning / Through Your Gills I Breathe (5:32)\n13 First Death In The Family (4:48)\n\nDead Cities is a seminal 1996 album by electronic music group The Future Sound of London.\n\nThough almost without lyrics to speak of, most of the first half of the album (with the exception of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHer Face Forms In SummertimeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) is dark and full of well structured malevolence in that its songs combine synthetic sounds with samples to create an apocalyptic, dystopian atmosphere, the second half of the disc is rather more relaxed however and FSOL combine the darkness with more of their now familiar complex, ambient techniques to create an odd, peaceful yet intriguing atmosphere.\n\nThe album art consisted of 3D graphics, photography, and writing complementing the albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s themes, combined via digital image editing. This was created primarily by the band and then-frequent artistic collaborator Buggy G. Riphead. A limited edition release of the album included a 196-page book, containing additional artwork and writing in the same style.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMy KingdomÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWe Have ExplosiveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ were released as singles. The ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMy KingdomÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ music video was directed by the same artistic collaboration, whereas the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWe Have ExplosiveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ music video was directed by 2D-animator Run Wrake.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:894c2a4cc448d3c5b3d546caa0f4117231805488","amp;dn":"FSOL+-+Dead+Cities+%281996%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"894c2a4cc448d3c5b3d546caa0f4117231805488","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,76,42,76,196,72,211,197,179,213,70,202,160,244,17,114,49,128,84,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
