Broken in body and spirit, he arrives home just in time to save from the hands of robbers a beautiful girl, Lady Joan Brandon, the daughter of the man whom he has sworn to punish. In a tavern he meets an old friend, Adam Penfeather, who unfolds to him the story of Black Bartlemy, an infamous pirate, and his treasure buried on an island--a treasure of inconceivable value that has been the dream and hope of roving adventurers along the Spanish Main for many years.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c81fdbfe3be0df64869d5c20a6416b6dbd163a5b","amp;dn":"Black+Bartlemy%27s+Treasure+by+Jeffrey+Farnol","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c81fdbfe3be0df64869d5c20a6416b6dbd163a5b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,31,219,254,59,224,223,100,134,157,92,32,166,65,107,109,189,22,58,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
