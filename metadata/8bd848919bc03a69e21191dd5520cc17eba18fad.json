Its first issue is cover dated July 1951 and its last November 1952, for a total of 5 issues. The title's creative team includes editor Sol Cohen, and artists Everett Raymond Kinstler, Louis Ravielli, Gene Fawcette, and Vince Alascia. Issue 1 presents the origin of the White Princess of the Jungle, Taanda. Historically, Taanda is predated in literature by Sheena, (a distaff Tarzan who inspired a number of comic book jungle girls), jungle lovely Rulah, and by Rima, the heroine of William Henry Hudson's novel Green Mansions (1904). Like most comics jungle girls, Taanda is white, intelligent, voluptuous, scantily clad in animal-skin bikinis, in possession of the ability to communicate with jungle beasts and birds, and wise to the ways of cruel men. Her life is devoted to preserving the peace and beauty of the jungle, confronting men up to no good, dickering with hostile, superstitious tribesmen, and exposing the deceits of bone-rattling witch doctors. Other characters who share Taanda's book include The Blue Gorilla, Captain Courage, White Hunter Jack Barnum and special guest Sheena, Queen of the Jungle. Readers are regaled with stories such as &quot;Slaves of the Diamond Mines&quot;, &quot;Coils of the Monster Snake&quot;, and &quot;Fangs of the Swamp Beast&quot;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8bd848919bc03a69e21191dd5520cc17eba18fad","amp;dn":"White+Princess+of+the+Jungle+COMPLETE+1951+Avon+Periodicals","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8bd848919bc03a69e21191dd5520cc17eba18fad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,216,72,145,155,192,58,105,226,17,145,221,85,32,204,23,235,161,143,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
