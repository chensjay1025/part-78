Beginning in 1969, Coleman began publishing a series of monographs and cassette tapes documenting the existence of the Committee of 300 and the New World Order. He is the author of Conspirators' Hierarchy: The Committee of 300, Pearl Harbor and Beyond: An account of Treachery and Treason, Gun Control: An Attack on the Whole Constitution and publishes World in Review [magazine].\n[from 5:00 until 17:00 in hour 4]\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://coleman300.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://coleman300.com/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Coleman_%28author%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Coleman_%28author%29&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.greatdreams.com/coleman.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.greatdreams.com/coleman.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nAlex also covers the news and takes calls.\n\n[Ted Anderson -- owner of the GCN radio network -- is in-studio for several minutes beginning at about 36:00 in hour 3, doing a &quot;live commercial&quot; for his gold business: Midas Resources.]\n\n\n\n\n##########################################\n\nNOTE :: Dr. Coleman has published 12 books and hundreds of white papers.  \nI am including the few titles I have in .pdf form.  \nIf you have others, particularly \n&quot;What You Should Know About The United States Constitution And The Bill Of Rights,&quot; \nplease contact me or leave a link in a comment.\n\n##########################################\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_torrents_info_PLEASE-READ.txt\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n\n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance.
