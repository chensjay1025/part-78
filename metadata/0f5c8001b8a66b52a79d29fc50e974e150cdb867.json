loaded the rom in the emulator.. \nto correct this bug is very simple.. \nit will be enough for you to plan the emulator as in the image.\n\n\n[IMG]http://img294.imageshack.us/img294/4936/74197289.png[/IMG]\n\n\nwhen you will have planned the emulator as in the image, loaded again the rom and the game should depart. \nIn the case in which this didn't have to happen planned the modality Flash 64K\ninstead of Flash 128K. \n\n\nDon't forget to say thanks\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f5c8001b8a66b52a79d29fc50e974e150cdb867","amp;dn":"Pokemon+Sinnoh+Quest+update2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f5c8001b8a66b52a79d29fc50e974e150cdb867","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,92,128,1,184,166,107,82,167,157,41,252,80,233,116,225,80,205,184,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
