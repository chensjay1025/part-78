And while insulting loved ones and destroying friendships is technically free, we're offering a nearly free alternative.\n\nStress Baal is a minor devil. You get to beat him up with your finger, and yes, he totally deserves it. Baal is hand animated like your favorite cartoon sponge or rabbit. Thousands upon thousands of drawings form the game. Not just a CG doll, the ever-scheming Baal has a personality. Granted, it's a loathsome one, but a personality nonetheless. Leave him idle and the little savage will probably save you the trouble and rough himself up... Often with fire.\n\nMore reasons to play Baal:\n- Like human endeavor, Stress Baal is pointless. No score, no achievements, no goals. Goals are what got you so stressed in the first place. \n- This pledge: We will never try to charge for additional content. No in app purchases ever. \n- We didn't do a Kickstarter.\nThis game is recommended for newer Android devices\n\nInstructions:\n\nInstall the apk,\nEnjoy.\n\n\nDon't forget to seed.If you like this then support the developers by buying.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa8744c948c096162e599b1214ab468aac98aa96","amp;dn":"Stress+Baal+v1.0.3+apk+android+%7Bms5d%7D+%5BAMRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa8744c948c096162e599b1214ab468aac98aa96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,135,68,201,72,192,150,22,46,89,155,18,20,171,70,138,172,152,170,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
