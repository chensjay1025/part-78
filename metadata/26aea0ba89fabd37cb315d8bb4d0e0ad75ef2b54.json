He comes to, finds some wreckage to float \n\non and washes up on the coast of Siam. After almost being eaten by a \n\ncrocodile, he is captured by Arab slave traders and taken to \n\nAyutthaya. Released from his bonds to be put on the auction block, he \n\npromptly knocks down his captors and leads them on a chase throughout \n\nthe ancient city.\n\nEventually, he iss brought under control, but not before he is \n\ncaptured the attention of a Eurasian beauty, Maria, who buys him his \n\nfreedom back. After recovering from his recapture, Maria brings \n\nFernando to meet her father, Phillippe. Fernando immediately \n\nrecognizes Phillippe as the man who killed Fernando's father many \n\nyears ago, whom Fernando has been seeking on a lifetime quest for \n\nrevenge.\n\nBut there are bigger battles to be fought. Fernando and his Portuguese \n\ncompatriots are pressed into the service of King Chairacha, who has to \n\ngo into battle. It is a multi-national taskforce, not only including \n\nPortuguese mercenaries, but also samurai warriors (likely Christians \n\nexpelled from Japan). In battle, Fernando bonds with a Thai warrior \n\nnamed Tong. They distinguish themselves by saving the King from an \n\nassassination attempt and are appointed his personal bodyguards.\n\nQueen Sudachan, a former royal consort who schemed her way into \n\nbecoming queen, is behind the assassination plot. Because it failed, \n\nshe calls on Don Phillippe for help. Phillippe in turn enlists a scar\n\n-faced ninja to kill the king. This plan is also thwarted by Fernando, \n\nTong and other Siamese troops. After the assassins are killed in the \n\nking's bedroom, King Chairacha assigns Tong and Fernando the task of \n\nseeking out whoever is behind this scheme.\n\nRecognizing one of the dead assassins as the scar-faced ninja he had \n\nseen Phillippe talking with earlier that night, Fernando confronts \n\nPhillippe. They fight, and Phillippe is killed by Tong. Meanwhile, the \n\nqueen resorts to black magic to poison the king. She also must kill \n\nher own son, Prince Yodfam (who is next in line for the throne), to \n\nclear the way for her boyfriend. This she achieves by hiring a spear-\n\nwielding African warrior.\n\nSucceeding in her plot, Fernando and Tong are then framed for the \n\ndeaths and made to fight each other in a death duel for Queen \n\nSudachan, her new king, and the crowd's amusement. Tong's family and \n\nMaria's life are threatened, and Tong throws an axe at the new king, \n\nslaying him. Moments before the queen kills Tong and Fernando in \n\nrevenge, King Chairacha's brother arrives. Having deduced on his own \n\nthat the queen is behind the king and prince's deaths, he arrests the \n\nqueen and releases our heroes and their loved ones. In an ending text, \n\nit is stated that news of these events were heard by the king of \n\nBurma, and that the story's impression of disarray is what caused the \n\nBurmese invasion and the eventual decline and destruction of \n\nAyutthaya.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26aea0ba89fabd37cb315d8bb4d0e0ad75ef2b54","amp;dn":"The+King+Maker+2005+VCD+%5BThai+Movie%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26aea0ba89fabd37cb315d8bb4d0e0ad75ef2b54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,174,160,186,137,250,189,55,203,49,93,139,180,208,224,173,117,239,43,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
