As they all seem to agree upon a common goal, the priceless art treasures in the monastery on nearby Mount Athena, Hecht is persuaded to join for a cut, but Zeno has a military agenda, as the allied invasion is approaching, and the monastery's mountain is also the cover for a secret German rocket installation...\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b7bf8acc465772eaaf92450a485bc63ed22b47e","amp;dn":"Athena%281979%29.DVDRip.GoGo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b7bf8acc465772eaaf92450a485bc63ed22b47e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,123,248,172,196,101,119,46,170,249,36,80,164,133,188,99,237,34,180,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
