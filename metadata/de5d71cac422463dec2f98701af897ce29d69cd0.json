Investigators \n        -  hardly pay  attention when  a clown  sneaks into  Jupiter's\n        birthday party and  tries to make  off with something.  Though\n        they don't catch  the clown, they  retrieve his booty:  it's a\n        tape of Jupiter's parents, who died several years earlier. The\n        only thing that's clear in the garbled tape is that  Jupiter's\n        parents were also investigators, and on the trail of something\n        big...  Jupiter vows  to solve  the mystery  his parents  were\n        working  on.  The only  clue  they have  is  the name  Stephen\n        Terrill,  a  once-famous inventor  who  lived in  what  is now\n        called  &quot;Terror Castle.&quot;  The boys  soon found  out how  aptly\n        chosen the name is: doors open by themselves, gates slam  shut\n        as  if  by  magic,  things  move,  slide,  crash,  appear  and\n        disappear. Plus there seems to be a ghost! It would all be too\n        much  for the  hardy trio  if it  weren't for  the ethereally\n        pretty Caroline, a little girl who claims she is a psychic and\n        fells a particularly  strong bond towards  Bob. Unfortunately,\n        Caroline is also the daughter of the local sheriff, who  shoos\n        them away  from Terror  Castle. It  takes more  than a  narrow\n        -eyed,   ill-tempered   sheriff  to   shake   off  the   three\n        investigators,  however, and  soon the  boys are  back in  the\n        house,  determined to  find out  what Jupiter's  parents were\n        looking for - something that  is supposed to be hidden  in the\n        house. Fearlessly defying the mysterious machines that seem to\n        make the house itself come alive, they penetrate to the secret\n        heart  of  Terror  Castle  and  come  upon  Stephen  Terrill's\n        invention: a  diamond-making machine!  But there's  no time to\n        admire the stones, for  the ghost of Stephen  Terrill appears \n        - and he doesn't like intruders...\n \n \n     \n                                           \n                      CAST                       \n                                               \n                                                       \n     \n \n\n                  Chancellor Miller  ....
