Sometime during 1950, a terrible catastrophe known as the &quot;Singularity&quot; occurred on the island, causing the island's very existence to be covered up by the Russian government. The player controls Nate Renko, an Air Force pilot who is sent to investigate bizarre radiation emissions coming from the island, only to crash land there. After regaining consciousness, Nate finds the TMD (Time Manipulation Device) and discovers that the island is constantly shifting between the time periods of 1950 and 2010. He also encounters Victor Barisov, the scientist in charge of the Katorga-12 experiments who reveals that a man named Nikolai Demichev is on the island to try to restart them on a much larger scale, which could cause an unthinkable disaster. During the quest to stop Demichev, the player will have to deal with hostile Russian forces in both time periods, and the hideously mutated flora, fauna and former residents of the island, some of which have developed time manipulation powers of their own.\n\n\n\nMinimum System Requirements for MicrosoftÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® XP:\n=======================================================\n \n3D hardware accelerator card required - 100% DirectXÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 9.0c-compliant 256 MB video card and drivers* \nMicrosoftÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® XP \nIntelÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® PentiumÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® D (dual core) 2.8GHz or AMD AthlonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ X2 4800+ or better \n1 GB of RAM \n8 GB of uncompressed hard disk space (plus 400 MB for the WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® swap file and 12 KB free for saved games) \nA 100% WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® XP-compatible computer system including: \nDirectXÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 9.0c (Included) \n100% DirectXÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 9.0c-compliant true 16-bit sound card and drivers \n100% WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® XP-compatible mouse, keyboard and drivers \n100% WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® XP-compatible 6x speed DVD-ROM drive (600 K/sec sustained transfer rate) and drivers** \n512 kB/sec upstream internet connection required to host \n*Supported Chipsets for WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® XP\n\nAll NVIDIAÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® GeForceÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 8800 GT 256 MB RAM and better chipsets (excluding GeForceÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 9400)\n\nAll ATI RadeonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ X1800 256 MB RAM and better chipsets (excluding X1800 GTO, RadeonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ HD2400, RadeonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ HD2600, and RadeonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ HD3450)\n\nMotherboard integrated video chipsets not supported\n\n\n\nMinimum System Requirements for MicrosoftÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® Windows VistaÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® and WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 7\n========================================================================\n\n3D hardware accelerator card required - 100% DirectXÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 9.0c-compliant 256 MB video card and drivers* \nMicrosoftÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® Windows VistaÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® or WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 7 \nIntelÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® PentiumÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® D (dual core) 2.8GHz or AMD AthlonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ X2 4800+ or better \n2 GB of RAM \n8 GB of uncompressed hard disk space (plus 400 MB for the WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® swap file and 12 KB free for saved games) \nA 100% Windows VistaÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® or WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 7 compatible computer system including: \nDirectXÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 9.0c (Included) \n100% DirectXÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 9.0c-compliant true 16-bit sound card and drivers \n100% Windows VistaÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® or WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 7 compatible mouse, keyboard and drivers \n100% Windows VistaÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® or WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 7 compatible 6x speed DVD-ROM drive (600 K/sec sustained transfer rate) and drivers** \n512 kB/sec upstream internet connection required to host \n*Supported Chipsets for Windows VistaÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® and WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 7\nAll NVIDIAÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® GeForceÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 8800 GT 256 MB RAM and better chipsets (excluding GeForceÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 9400)\n\nAll ATI RadeonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ X1800 256 MB RAM and better chipsets (excluding X1800 GTO, RadeonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ HD2400, RadeonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ HD2600, and RadeonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ HD3450)\n\nMotherboard integrated video chipsets not supported\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                ***** enjoy ... *****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28ff36f6eee9534f904aff35ef3cc7974d5799b5","amp;dn":"PC+%C3%82%C2%BB+SINGULARITY+Full+Game+directplay+by+globe%40","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28ff36f6eee9534f904aff35ef3cc7974d5799b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,255,54,246,238,233,83,79,144,74,255,53,239,60,199,151,77,87,153,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
