She had six singles in the British Top 100 in a 19 month span from March 1983 -October 1984. Melody Maker once described her retro 60ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s style sound as somewhere between ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMinnie Mouse and the SupremesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\n\nIn 1982 while starring on the BBC tv program ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThree of A KindÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, Ullman was persuaded to record an album ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œYou Broke My Heart in 17 PlacesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ for Stiff Records, which quickly became a #14 pop chart album hit in the U.K, featuring three top ten singles.\n\nIn 1984, a follow up album, entitled ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œYou Caught Me OutÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was released. Other than a Kirsty MacColl co-produced cut, it was produced by Peter Colins, as was her debut. \n\nDespite her success in the music biz, Ullman, a talented actress, singer, dancer, screenwriter, and author, is most famous for being the host of her eponymous variety television shows. Ullman has an extraordinary ability to mimic accents, with her numerous characters rarely sounding anything like her normal accent.\n\nHer professional entertainment career began at age 17 as a ballet dancer in Germany, and eventually she appeared in London stage productions of The Rocky Horror Picture Show, Grease etc. By 1980 she won the London Theater Critics Award and gained a foothold in television.\n\nAlbums:\n1983 - Breakaway &amp; Dancing in the Dark (EU 7'' Singles)\n1983 - Move Over Darling &amp; You Broke My Heart in 17 Places (UK 7'' Singles)\n1983 - You Broke My Heart In 17 Places\n1984 - Breakaway &amp; Long Live Love (US 7'' Singles)\n1984 - My Guy's &amp; Mad At Me (UK 12'' Single)\n1984 - They Don't Know &amp; You Broke My Heart in 17 Place (US 7'' Singles)\n1984 - You Caught Me Out (Vinyl Rip)\n1992 - The Best of Tracey Ullman\n1996 - The Very Best Of\n\nVideo:\nTracey Ullman - Breakaway.mpg\nTracey Ullman ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ My Guy.mpg\nTracey Ullman - They Don't Know (Bananas Festival Version).mpg\nTracey Ullman - They Don't Know.mpg\n\nBonus:\nTracey Ullman - Give Him A Great Big Kiss.mp3\nTracey Ullman - I Don't Want Our Loving To Die.mp3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b5f306280edf39500125315042c996ba817dc3d","amp;dn":"Tracey+Ullman+-+Discography+%26+Video+%281983-2000%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b5f306280edf39500125315042c996ba817dc3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,95,48,98,128,237,243,149,0,18,83,21,4,44,153,107,168,23,220,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
