The layout of the course follows the layout of all the other courses produced in the 1970s by linguaphone: You follow a family who speaks the target language (in this case Spanish) as they travel back to their country of &quot;origin&quot; where the language originates and &quot;experience&quot; their adventures.\n\n\nTarget language: Spanish\n\nLearning language: English\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n1. The coursebook wasn't scanned from the original book: I got it from another source (Russian). It was originally a parallel text, Spanish on the left and Russian on the right, so I just &quot;removed&quot; (cropped) the Russian text.\n\n2. I didn't scan the Spanish-English dictionary at the end of the handbook. \n\n3. The Writing excercise book isn't included.\n\n4. I split the audio into sections according to the lesson/sub headings.\n\n5. This isn't the same Spanish course being sold today by Linguaphone.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb769152b995ab7df2f962dd8202c84f92d5b9bc","amp;dn":"Linguaphone+Spanish+%281973%29+PDFs%2BAudio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb769152b995ab7df2f962dd8202c84f92d5b9bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,118,145,82,185,149,171,125,242,249,98,221,130,2,200,79,146,213,185,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
