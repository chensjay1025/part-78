Anything you were familiar with V4 is still there, it might be displayed differently though. More guides on how to use V5 to come!\n\n1. New Interface\nNew display for clearer view and new live preview: no more converting files you're not totally happy with, no more wondering how the menu, the file, the subs, etc will come out.\nAny editing is shown live on the preview.\nNow you can customize your menus like an artist!\nNew feature: Edit menu duration!\n\n2. New edition options\nSubtitles, with new advanced features, like embedding subs directly into the video\nNEW: add brightness and contrast for a better image, flip the video\nVideo format: select the right format according to your TV screen, apply your own values for ultimate editing\nNEW: Remove unwanted parts of your video: say goodbye to ads, or anything you want to cut out, anywhere in the video, with exact selection (frame by frame) for professional result.\n\n3. Encoding Features\nA new conversion engine has been developped especially for this V5.\nNow you can have faster conversions with the simultaneous conversion feature (if you add more than one video) and hardware decoding (if available on your PC)\n\n- better audio quality due to rewritten engine\n- audio/video desynchronisation problems should be nearly non-existant - one of the main reasons for rewritten engine\n- add chapters support (original chapters supported and/or import chapters from list)\n- Version 5 has a new text renderer, meaning we are using a different engine than what was used in version 4 for text in menus and subtitles. We are now using Free type text renderer which provides visually nicer results.\n\n\nConvertXtoDVD changes history\nConvertXtoDVD - 5.0.0.74 Released August 8th, 2013\n===========================================\n- 0006898: [Bug] Rounding issues (felicia) - resolved.\n- 0006902: [Feature Request] Log warns when subtitle file is ignored even if it's added later (felicia) - resolved.\n- 0006901: [Bug] Problems when exiting application while in full screen mode (felicia) - resolved.\n- 0006897: [Bug] No sound in menu preview (wesson) - resolved.\n\n\nCerberus Patch Install Instructions:\nStep 1.
