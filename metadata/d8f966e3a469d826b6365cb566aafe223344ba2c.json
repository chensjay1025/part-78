Throughout the brief, the authors propose new schemes and protocols to increase the security of IP addresses within VANETs including an anonymous and location privacy-preserving scheme for the MIPv6 protocol, a mutual authentication scheme that thwarts authentication attacks, and a fake point-cluster based scheme to prevent attackers from localizing users inside NEMO-based VANET hotspots. The brief concludes with future research directions. Professionals and researchers will find the analysis and new privacy schemes outlined in this brief a valuable addition to the literature on VANET management.\n\nPlease Rate and Comment\n\nPlease Seed atleast upto 1:1 Ratio","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8f966e3a469d826b6365cb566aafe223344ba2c","amp;dn":"Secure+IP+Mobility+Management+for+VANET+%28PDF%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8f966e3a469d826b6365cb566aafe223344ba2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,249,102,227,164,105,216,38,182,54,92,181,102,170,254,34,51,68,186,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
