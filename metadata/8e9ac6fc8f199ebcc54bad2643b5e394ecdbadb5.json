I find that most TV movies of this length lose any rhythm when watched on multiple nights and, of course, broken by commercials. With that condition, I enjoyed it. I found the story interesting and the production good. It would be a movie that most family members could watch, although younger viewers are often wanting the special effects and impact of 'big-budget' movies.\n\nParts of the movies are predictable, but I found those occasions something to smile at since I recognized the idea before they happened. I was disappointed that the few fight scenes came off poorly -- this plot doesn't need a lot of them, and the didn't overdue them -- just not the quality we expect these days.\n\nOverall, good for a TV movie. Worth watching, but I probably would not watch it a second time.
