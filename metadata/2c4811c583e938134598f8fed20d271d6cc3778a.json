You should also check that the MD5 matches the MD5 found online.\n\nWhats the goal of this program?\nTo activate you in a clean and simple way without putting a load of buttons and checkboxes on your screen and expecting you to know what to do. It's all about keeping it simple!\n\nWhat makes this different from every other loader out at the moment?\nIt's the only fully coded API based loader application, this means it cuts out the middle man (.NET framework) and can handle everything on it's own. This increases reliability and is considered the professional coder approach.\n\nSo whats the advantages and why should you care?\nWith me building this loader as an application I can access system details and create declares for many of the functions. This means anyone that uses this loader should have a greater chance of success!\n\nWhats the differences between each loader option?\nEach option uses a slightly different method to get you activated, of course the custom menu.lst option should be ignored unless you know what you're doing.\n\nOK so how do I run it?\nIn general you simply press Install!\n\nI activated Windows 7 and now I want to activate Windows Vista, why isn't it working?\nUse the uninstall option while on Windows 7 and reboot into Windows Vista. Next install your selected cert/slic in Windows Vista and then reboot back to Windows 7 and click install.\n\nActivation failed, now what?\nTry again with one of the other loader options, maybe one of them might just work for you.\n\nApplication integrity checking?\nHover your mouse over the green, amber or red icon towards the bottom right of the window to see the information.\n\nI should note that even if the icon is green someone might have found a way around it so it's worth checking that the applications path is always the same as the location from where you launched the application. You should also check that the MD5 matches the MD5 found online.\n\nSupport Page: http://forums.mydigitallife.info/showthread.php?t=8632\n\nWindows Loader.exe Hashes:\nMD5: 8e3982049e03023f39c4cf6dec74c1e3\nSHA-1: 3ab1bb831ab3ebb3cdf4d486939aea0eb2881e1b","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c4811c583e938134598f8fed20d271d6cc3778a","amp;dn":"Windows+Loader+v+1.8.2.zip+++carter67","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c4811c583e938134598f8fed20d271d6cc3778a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,72,17,197,131,233,56,19,69,152,248,254,210,13,39,29,108,195,119,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
