One might be forgiven for feeling a little weary of this genre as the big production studios churn out one &quot;action-packed film with a cute central character and some pretty effects&quot; after another. But wait...\n\nHTTYD stands apart from these other attempts for a number of reasons. First, the 3D (Odeon digital in this screening) is moving more toward the subtle with fewer &quot;gratuitous&quot; 3D moments than in movies like Bolt and Coraline. As 3D becomes a staple of high street cinema, directors seem to be finding 3D to be more about adding depth rather than a brief focal-point. That's not to say that there isn't effective use of the 3D wow-factor here; it's just not all the film has to hold attention.\n\nSecond, a cast of voice talent that does not demand too much consideration of the man/woman behind the microphone is refreshing. Baruchel is not over-playing the sugar or the heroics and, as much as an animated character can be, he is believable and as three-dimensional as the visuals. Butler is not greatly stretched here but manages to stay just the right side of a Mike Myers impression so as not to annoy. How many kids will now think the Vikings were a fearsome race of Americans and Scots? Oh, well! \n\nThird, the plot and dialogue. You may not know the plot and I won't spoil it now. It is straightforward stuff but the pace keeps it interesting for kids and the grown-ups. Younger children may be upset at times and I heard a sob or two at the emotional moments. Nothing too heavy here though, it's just a well-written script with as many actual laughs as I have seen in a kids' film.\n\nThis is one of the best films so far in this prolific genre and it has been made with passion rather than thrown together to cash-in on the thirst for these films, right now. I would urge all ages to see this film in 3D as the textures are extraordinary and you can't help but be charmed by it all.\n\nRelease Date: 23 March 2010 (USA)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d287cfcd3b2f5099015a5223222461f6ff3edde2","amp;dn":"How+to+Train+Your+Dragon+%28Movie+Trailer%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d287cfcd3b2f5099015a5223222461f6ff3edde2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,135,207,205,59,47,80,153,1,90,82,35,34,36,97,246,255,62,221,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
