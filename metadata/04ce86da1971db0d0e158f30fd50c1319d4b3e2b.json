Most particularly, it utilises correspondence from and to Spike, taken from the BBC Written Archives, much of it never before seen or heard by a wide audience. Spike's correspondence with the BBC covered many topics and was never less than hugely entertaining; this tribute contains the best of it.\n\nEnjoy....Fnut!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04ce86da1971db0d0e158f30fd50c1319d4b3e2b","amp;dn":"Vivat+Milligna%21.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04ce86da1971db0d0e158f30fd50c1319d4b3e2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,206,134,218,25,113,219,13,14,21,143,48,253,80,193,49,157,75,62,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
