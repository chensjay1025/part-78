Do not \ntry to use the old one, cause it will not work.\n\n\nFixed Issues:\n-------------\n\n- The patching process no longer fails if host file \nis read only and/or hidden.\n\n- Drastic decrease in file size. This patch is more\nthan twice as small as its predecessor. \n\n- Offline patch no longer requires write access to\nthe Windows registry.\n\n- Game now bootable from a desktop shortcut instead\nor a seperate launcher folder.\n\n- People who use this crack no longer start with a\ntotal of 1821 GDI Experience Points.\n\n- Should work for a lot more people thanks to loads\nof small bug fixes.\n\n\nKnown Issues:\n-------------\n\n- Progress jumps back to mission two after restart.\n\nThe emulator is an 0.1 alpha version, so I bet it's\ngoing to get fixed real soon. I'll release a new\nversion of this application everytime a new emulator\ncomes out so stay tuned! Saving your progress at the\nbeginning of a new mission before closing the game\nshould work just fine until then.\n\n\nOther Issues:\n-------------\n\nThe following game issues are not crack related, so\nplease check out the official Command &amp; Conquer 4\nforum for tips on how to fix them.\n\n- Playback problems with sound effects and voices.\n- Black screen directly after the EA intro clip.\n\n\nClarifications:\n---------------\n\nIt's normal that you will NOT gain any experience points \nfrom the first few missions since they are nothing but a \nshort tutorial. This is not a bug.\n\nIt is not necessary to copy this patch to the Command &amp;\nConquer 4 game directory. However, the file and folder \nstructures have to be intact when you patch the game.\n\nThere is no need for the patch files to remain on your\nPC once the procedure is finished, but please keep them\nfor seeding purposes. Thank you in advance!\n\n\nCredits:\n--------\n\nDeveloped and brought to you by Blacktronic ~\nBased on an emulator by KoriTama ~\n\nMade possible by feedback from TPB users.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42ffc50fd61031b41cc16eefbf527140d7b8d470","amp;dn":"Command+%26+Conquer+4+Crack+v2.0+%7C+Automated+Patch+%2B+Shortcut","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42ffc50fd61031b41cc16eefbf527140d7b8d470","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,255,197,15,214,16,49,180,28,193,110,239,191,82,113,64,215,184,212,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
