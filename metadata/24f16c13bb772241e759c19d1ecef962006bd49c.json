The band finished off their annual New York residency with a show that took no prisoners and didn't hold anything back.\n\nThe first set opened with several tried and true classics like &quot;Statesboro Blues&quot; and &quot;Stand Back,&quot; guaranteed to get the crowd moving, but the show really hit its stride at the end of the first set.  A poignant reading of &quot;All My Friends,&quot; the Cowboy classic from the Laid Back album, showed Gregg's vocals at their world-weary best.  The new instrumental called &quot;Bag End&quot; really takes off at this show, the best one the ABB played at the Palace.  Then the band slides right into the gritty blues of Dylan's &quot;Blind Willie McTell,&quot; with both Gregg and Warren singing from deep in their soul.  The band surprised everyone by closing the first set with &quot;Whipping Post&quot; for the second time in the run, setting a high bar for the second set.\n\nLucky for us, the band was more than up to the challenge!  This magnificent combo of &quot;Little Martha&quot; and &quot;Blue Sky&quot; was nothing less than spectacular and reflected the beautiful sunny weather of this day in New York.  On the other end of the spectrum, &quot;No One To Run With&quot; was all raw power and fire, with Derek ripping a nasty slide solo.  &quot;The Same Thing&quot; was performed in the rare &quot;slow version&quot; style, one of only a handful in ABB history, and this one is the best!  Check out Kofi Burbridge's jazzy flute solo, not something you would normally hear in this song, and Warren really sings the blues on this one.\n\nThe highlight of the show, if not the whole run, was jazz sax player Bill Evans sitting on incredible versions of &quot;Dreams&quot; and &quot;Elizabeth Reed&quot; that rival any versions from recent years.  Evans adds just the right jazzy touch on his solos, and the whole band is cooking and hittin' the note!\n\nA double encore of &quot;Preachin' Blues&quot; and &quot;You Don't Love Me&quot; sealed this as a very special end to a very special run of shows.  Peakin' at the Palace indeed!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24f16c13bb772241e759c19d1ecef962006bd49c","amp;dn":"The+Allman+Brothers+-+LIVE+03%2F20%2F2010+%5B320k+MP3%5D+NYC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24f16c13bb772241e759c19d1ecef962006bd49c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,241,108,19,187,119,34,65,231,89,193,157,30,206,249,98,0,107,212,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
