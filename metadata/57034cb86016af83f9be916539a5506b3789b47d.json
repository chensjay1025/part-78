In all, we handed out a case of Qurans, many hundreds of the petition to Obama, held some very interesting conversation and also, by the will of Allah, attained one shahada, al-hamdulilah. Shaikh Abdul Malik's presentation was superb and the people were incredibly receptive. Of course the blamers will blame and the cursers will curse, but at the end of the day we would like to see what you/they are doing for Islam? Wake up ya muslimeen!!!\n&quot;Invite (all) to the Way of thy Lord with wisdom and beautiful preaching; and argue with them in ways that are best and most gracious: for thy LordÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â»Ã‚Â¿ knoweth best, who have strayed from His Path, and who receive guidance.&quot;(Quran 16:125)\n\nProphet Muhammad(PUH) said: &quot;Whoever among you sees an evil action, then let him changeÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â»Ã‚Â¿ it with his hand [by taking action]; if he cannot, then with his tongue [by speaking out]; and if he cannot, then with his heart and that is the weakest of faith.&quot; \n\nScreen shot:    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/NaMekaACf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/NaMekaACf&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/naMEiaacf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/naMEiaacf&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/nAmelAAcf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/nAmelAAcf&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf you like this release, Please leave your comments  \nNote: I will stop seeding after 3-4 days, so, grab it NOW.
