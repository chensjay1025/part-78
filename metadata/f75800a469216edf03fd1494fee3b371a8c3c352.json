The label aimed to continue the success King had enjoyed at Stax mixing blues backing and vocals with pop/soul arrangements and lyrics. He recorded six LPs for Tomato; this anthology culls 14 cuts from his Tomato releases, among them the slashing numbers &quot;Blues At Sunrise&quot; and &quot;I'm Gonna Call You Soon As The Sun Goes Down,&quot; which vividly illustrated King's guitar prowess. Others, like &quot;Truckload Of Lovin'&quot; and &quot;We All Wanna Boogie,&quot; show how he skillfully crammed moments of inspiration into formulaic outings. \n\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n01.
