Erica \n       Duggan's son died in disputed circumstances in Germany, while Bill \n       Hawker's daughter, Lindsay, was found murdered in Tokyo. Faced \n       with a foreign culture and police and lawyers they could barely \n       communicate with, they gradually came to believe the only hope of \n       uncovering the truth was to take on the investigation themselves.\n\n\n                             Big up all scene massive!\n\n\n    \n                                       \n                GROUP  INFORMATION          \n         9 Years of the Force and still    \n                      going strong                  \n     \n\n           What we are looking for:\n\n           * gigabit euro sites for x264 only\n           * Fios x264 rippers or cappers\n           * also we have a contest to annouce we are in need of a\n           * new nfo ascii artwork design email us with your designs\n           * winners artwork will be added as our new nfo\n           * dont forget to tag your work\n           * If you think you can help contact us on irc\n           * or email us at &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;adebc2dfcec8edc5d8dec583ccc4&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82f42d2063fad1e6afae4c6ec2d4c044a442a6c4","amp;dn":"Cutting.Edge-Lost.Abroad.The.Parents.Story.2010.WS.PDTV.XviD-aAF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82f42d2063fad1e6afae4c6ec2d4c044a442a6c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,244,45,32,99,250,209,230,175,174,76,110,194,212,192,68,164,66,166,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
