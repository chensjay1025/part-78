Or maybe I should say &quot;Doktor&quot; \nbecause that's how he incorrectly spells the word!\n\nMy only complaint is that it takes place in a dusty old \nmansion, as too many episodes did. But somehow that \ndoesn't take away from a well-done script.\n\nThe guest stars are Dick York (before Bewitched) and \nCarolyn Kearney.\n\nCoincidentally, Elizabeth Montgomery had done a \nTHRILLER that same season with Tom Poston, the amusing \nvampire story &quot;Masquerade&quot;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ffc790151d00f5b9d64260018f9ce6da5d3cfcb","amp;dn":"THRILLER+--+The+Incredible+Doktor+Markesan+%28+2nd+Season+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ffc790151d00f5b9d64260018f9ce6da5d3cfcb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,252,121,1,81,208,15,91,157,100,38,0,24,249,206,109,165,211,207,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
