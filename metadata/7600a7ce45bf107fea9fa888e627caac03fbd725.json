Nick Ferguson (Rhett Giles) is the detective on the edge, drawn back into a police investigation with great trepidation after being wounded by a diabolical murderer. What tips off the fact that this is an Asylum-style product is a scene directly lifted from SILENCE, where the villain pretends to be a victim (only instead of wearing a cast and trying to lift a heavy chair into a van, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s just a dude in a wheelchair asking for change, luring in his prey through the force of his personality). THE FEAR CHAMBER does make a few tepid attempts at being different from the Thomas Harris adaptations, such as making its protagonist a psychic instead of merely a perceptive investigator, and having the slayer steal body parts from his victims to sell on the black market instead of wearing them Ed Gein-style.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0999972/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0999972/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7600a7ce45bf107fea9fa888e627caac03fbd725","amp;dn":"The+Fear+Chamber%5B2009%5DDvDrip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7600a7ce45bf107fea9fa888e627caac03fbd725","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,0,167,206,69,191,16,127,234,159,168,136,230,39,202,172,3,251,215,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
