The crazed products and the equally unhinged presenters become ever more involved in the farcical demands of the badly run TV station.\n\nBuyMeUp TV is like every shopping channel you've ever seen - product demonstrations, guests, auctions, infomercials, dramatic price reductions, testimonials, phone lines, order pages, horoscopes, bargains, special offers, and life-changing stories. It sells everything you can possibly imagine for your home, vehicle, health, entertainment, lifestyle, wardrobe and bathroom. Owned by a vast American cable network, it is a 24-hour live broadcast channel selling crap to the whole nation.\n\nEach episode is also peppered with idents and adverts for ludicrous products they are forced to sell, from Robert Mugabe beach towels and the Jeffery Archery set, to the Guitar Bra and a communist doorbell.\n\nwww.comedy.co.uk Review: \nIt seems the press didn't think much of this four-part sitcom when it was broadcast, we loved it though. From the crazy infomercials to the crazed staff, Edwards and Eldred's scripts kept us chuckling. The best bits were probably the guest stars appearing as monstrous versions of themselves.\n\nCast:\nJustin Edwards\nKatherine Jakeways\nAlex MacQueen\nGreg Proops\nEwen MacIntosh\nColin Hoult\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/radio/buy_me_up_tv/episodes/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/radio/buy_me_up_tv/episodes/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nBuy Me Up TV - S01 - E01 - Eammon Holmes\nBuy Me Up TV - S01 - E02 - Ruth Madox\nBuy Me Up TV - S01 - E03 - Rich Hall\nBuy Me Up TV - S01 - E04 - Sir Terry Wogan\n\n\n\nAudio Format    : MP3\nDuration Approx : 28mn 0s\nBit rate mode   : Constant\nBit rate        : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)      : 2 channels\nSampling rate   : 44.1 KHz\nResolution      : 16 bits\n\n\n[b]\n\n\nA number of people are posting my torrents on other trackers.\nI have no problem with that - (Not much need as I already do this) - But a name check would be nice\nI was the one who spent weeks,months,years recording them\n\n\n[/b]\n\n.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:024cd55ed039cb85c572b6520d5eb33e8b09c400","amp;dn":"Buy+Me+Up+TV+-+S01+-+Audio+Comedy+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"024cd55ed039cb85c572b6520d5eb33e8b09c400","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,76,213,94,208,57,203,133,197,114,182,82,13,94,179,62,139,9,196,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
