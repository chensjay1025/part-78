Frank Baum (1856-1919). Published in 1908, while Baum was resident in Coronado, California, it is considered one of the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œdarkerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ of the Oz tales. However, it also is enlivened by BaumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s considerable wit, penchant for puns, and dry social commentary. In this title, Dorothy, her kitten Eureka, Jim, a cab horse, and Zeb, a ranch hand, descend into the earth through a rift opened by an earthquake. There they encounter the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œhumbugÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ wizard who once ruled Oz. In their journey back to the earthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s surface, they meet a number of potentially dangerous magical peoples and creatures including the cold-blooded Mangaboos, invisible bears, the flying wooden Gargoyles, a den of dragonettes, and an eccentric inventor. With a little help from Ozma, the group end up in Oz where they are treated to feasts and celebrations. The animals end up humbled by a few of their experiences in Oz, where all animals can talk, and return home a little wiser.
