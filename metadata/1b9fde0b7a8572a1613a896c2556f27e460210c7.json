Quite typical to such genre of movies, he comes across Annalakshmi (Sunaina) , who is conservative in her looks. After a few initial encounters, the girl develops love for him.But Anand has other plans. The mystery is soon unraveled and is made known that Anand hails from a family of doctors. When everyone thinks Anand will tie the knot to Annalakshmi, the twist occurs in the form of Anand accepting an arranged marriage. What transpires between the lead couple forms the rest of the story which ends in an interesting climax.Sachin, though a debutante, plays his part well. He is cool and suave in his role, while Sunaina does exceedingly well. Unlike her earlier movies, she sports 'pavadai thavani' and renders a subdued performance that fits the role to the T. Azhagamperumal impresses.Interestingly, Balakumar has allowed the story to dominate rather than a host of characters come, speak and go in such films. Giving life to the script is enchanting music by James Vasanthan. A couple of melodious duets by him stay in our ears.On the flip side, the slow pace in which the movie progresses and few oft-repeated scenes of Tamil cinema takes away the sheen.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b9fde0b7a8572a1613a896c2556f27e460210c7","amp;dn":"Yathumaagi+%282010%29+X264+350MB+SRUTHI+DVDRip+.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b9fde0b7a8572a1613a896c2556f27e460210c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,159,222,11,122,133,114,161,97,58,137,108,37,86,242,126,70,2,16,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
