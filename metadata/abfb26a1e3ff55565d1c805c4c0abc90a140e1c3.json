Just as the stone-cold bummer of the 1970s begat Andy Kaufman, Albert Brooks and the golden-age National Lampoon, the fascism creep of the aughties opened a sprawling ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œunderground comedyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ landscape, ranging from the explosive cynicism of Doug Stanhope to the melancholic absurdity of Zach Galafianakis. But unlike Brooks and NatLamp, most of todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s comedy luminaries have yet to really capitalize on the potential of the long-playing album. The typical comedy album remains essentially a glorified demo reel, a well-broken set performed in front of a sympathetic audience (which is usually mixed way too loud). ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a stacked deck. A few of the more brazen rebels of the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢90s experimented with taping in front of unfriendly audiences (see Bill HicksÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Flying Saucer Tour or Andrew Dice ClayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s probably-forever-unsung classic The Day the Laughter Died), but if these records sounded weird, that spoke more of the genreÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s creative poverty than of ClayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s and HicksÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s courage. More recently, even the highest-profile innovators havenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t tried much new on wax.\n\nEnter alienated San Francisco art nerd Brent Weinbach. If GalifianakisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s boozy outrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© concert film Live at the Purple Onion wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t quite comedyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Magical Mystery Tour, WeinbachÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s The Night Shift isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t quite its White Album. (It might be closer to Pure Guava.) But, for a comedy record, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s got a damned impressive experimental streak, and it deserves to be widely influential.\n\nWeinbach celebrates cathartic awkwardness, not just in his material (when asked, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAre you retarded?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ our man responds, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNo. I mean, I was retarded. But I worked out so much on my SoloFlex, my brain muscles got buff with the rest of my bodyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½), but also in his production values. Less than half of The Night Shift is recorded live. The rest consists of manic, often confrontational voicemails from his alternate personae, a few approximately sincere Tin-Pan-Alley weepers, and, most intriguingly, a lot of studio-recorded auditory noir which recalls nothing so much as a gleefully immature take on the radio theater of Joe Frank.\n\nMuch as the comedians of the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢70s spoke on the intellectual constipation of their parents and the washed-out utopianism of their hippie peers, Weinbach speaks to the claustrophobic estrangement, the muted pessimism, and particularly the deep-seeded awkwardness of the typical post-W urbanite. Some of this stuff is more fascinating than ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œfunny,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ but, nonetheless, I predict big, big things for this one-of-a-kind young man.\n\nBy Emerson Dameron\n\nBrent Weinbach - 01 - Tyreese\nBrent Weinbach - 02 - Substitute Teaching Reprise\nBrent Weinbach - 03 - Jokes\nBrent Weinbach - 04 - Top Gunner\nBrent Weinbach - 05 - San Francisco Phone Call\nBrent Weinbach - 06 - Women\nBrent Weinbach - 07 - My Heart Has Sprung\nBrent Weinbach - 08 - Brian\nBrent Weinbach - 09 - Happy Birthday\nBrent Weinbach - 10 - San Francisco Phone Call 2\nBrent Weinbach - 11 - Making Sense\nBrent Weinbach - 12 - I'm Mean\nBrent Weinbach - 13 - Friends For Life\nBrent Weinbach - 14 - IntimiDate\nBrent Weinbach - 15 - Scotty\nBrent Weinbach - 16 - Monologue\nBrent Weinbach - 17 - San Francisco Phone Call 3\nBrent Weinbach - 18 - Language\nBrent Weinbach - 19 - The Band\nBrent Weinbach - 20 - Seance\nBrent Weinbach - 21 - Russian Alphabet\nBrent Weinbach - 22 - Origins\nBrent Weinbach - 23 - Orchestra\nBrent Weinbach - 24 - A Perfect Day To Say I Love You","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:abfb26a1e3ff55565d1c805c4c0abc90a140e1c3","amp;dn":"Standup+Comedy+-+Brent+Weinbach+-+The+Night+Shift","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"abfb26a1e3ff55565d1c805c4c0abc90a140e1c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,251,38,161,227,255,85,86,93,28,128,92,76,10,188,144,161,64,225,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
