Carl Sagan`s TV Mini-Serie Cosmos from 1980 is now on Blu-Ray, but hold your horses!!! it`s not in HD (and vill probably never be as most was recorded on SD video) it`s just all 7 NTSC DVD`s compiled to a single BD-50 disc (iso file) with a simple menu.\n\nAll 13 episodes are in FULL DVD-9 quality (no re-encode has been done) I also edit out all the idioticly inserted &quot;10 years later&quot; updates at the end of the episodes, and removed one audio track and all subtitles except the english.\n\nThis is version nr 3, there will not be another one!!!\n\nChanges made between v1 and v2 is mostly in the subtitles, fixed some errors in the subs in episode 1 and 3 and removed the CC inserts in the text on all episodes, and a few other small changes.\n\nChanges between v2 and v3 is very tiny, the end of episode 6 is a little better edited and one or two other fixes that nobody will ever notice.\n\nBut the edit cuts at the end of the episodes that had the  &quot;10 years later updates&quot; is still not perfect, but I prefer this until a new DVD set comes out.\n\nAll 3 versions play perfect on my PS3 burned to a BD-RE 50GB disc, so you dont have to download this new one.\n\nTo tell the different versions apart\nv1 .nrg file\nv2 .img file, and slightly smaller in size then v1\nv3 .iso file, and it`s the biggest file of the 3, but only a tiny bit!\n\nAudio: English DD 5.1 448 kbps\nSubtitles: English\nSize 46,4 GB (49Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â 909Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â 858Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â 304 byte)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:649c0f1567975b75755a3455935f408b13cf16e3","amp;dn":"Carl+Sagan%60s+Cosmos+Blu-Ray","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"649c0f1567975b75755a3455935f408b13cf16e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,156,15,21,103,151,91,117,117,90,52,85,147,95,64,139,19,207,22,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
