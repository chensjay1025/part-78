LewisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ beloved Chronicles of Narnia, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, will be released in December 2010. In a crowded market of predictable tie-ins, Through the Wardrobe-a collection of always thoughtful, frequently clever explorations of the series by sixteen popular YA authors that proves the series is more than its religious underpinnings-stands out.\n\nStep through the wardrobe and into the imaginations of these friends of Aslan as they explore Narnia-from The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe to The Last Battle, from the heart of CaspianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s kingdom to the Eastern Seas. Find out:\n\nÃ‚â€¢ Why Edmund Pevensie is totally crush-worthy\nÃ‚â€¢ What tea and Turkish Delight have to do with World War II\nÃ‚â€¢ Why The Voyage of the Dawn Treader will be the best movie of the series\nÃ‚â€¢ What Susan really did to get herself booted out of Narnia (it wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the pantyhose or the lipstick)\n\nThe seriesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ roots in C.S. LewisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Christianity are important, but thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more to Narnia than just the religious symbolism. Through the Wardrobe, edited by internationally bestselling British fantasy author Herbie Brennan, reveals new levels of richness and delight the other Narnia books overlook.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:824960e5b16d2acc34268816e3bd7896970f285a","amp;dn":"Through+the+Wardrobe+-+Your+Favorite+Authors+on+C.S.+Lewis%27+Chro","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"824960e5b16d2acc34268816e3bd7896970f285a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,73,96,229,177,109,42,204,52,38,136,22,227,189,120,150,151,15,40,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
