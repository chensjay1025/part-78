U.S. warplanes are currently touching down in Cyprus, which is the likely hub for future air campaigns in the Middle East. The U.S. could launch a missile attack against Syria as early as Thursday. In response, the Dow fell near 100 points as investors worry about the war leading to market turmoil. \n\nDr. Noel Sharkey joins the broadcast to talk about the future of robots for police and military use. The elites could try an end run around the Constitution by deploying robots equipped with weapons that, unlike human soldiers, won't refuse to obey unlawful and unconstitutional orders. \n\nAlex also interviews Paul Craig Roberts on how U.S. officials are radicalizing Muslim groups in order to destabilize Russia and China.\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential \n to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a\n spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the &quot;big \n picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media \n for news and info is a prescription for ignorance.
