Because the Internet is open 24 hours \na day a number of different viruses can be carrying out attacks on computers all around the world at any given moment. Viruses are written \nfor a number of reasons but most virus programmers are motivated either by financial or technical gains. A discrete and professional \nprogrammer can make large amounts of money for designing and programming a virus. A lot of computer viruses do not seem that bad and will \nonly send messages to the user as a joke, but the prank computer virus is a thing of the past. The most dangerous type of virus is \nfinancially backed, well programmed, and will infect millions of computers without giving the computer users the slightest clue. What most \npeople do not realize about computer viruses is the extent of their destruction and their unseen benefits.\n\nFeel free to leave comments and suggestion.\nFollow on Twitter for updates and new releases: SpaceAgeMinds\nHelp support the seed server, please reseed. \nDon't forget to check out my online computer store.\n\nYou will need 7-zip to expand this archive: http://www.7-zip.org\n\nThanks and Enjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25e1ff66647f91a9ea3a2f662790dfc7383cabc5","amp;dn":"Viruses%2C+the+potential+dangers+and+unseen+benefits%7BPDF%7D%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25e1ff66647f91a9ea3a2f662790dfc7383cabc5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,225,255,102,100,127,145,169,234,58,47,102,39,144,223,199,56,60,171,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
