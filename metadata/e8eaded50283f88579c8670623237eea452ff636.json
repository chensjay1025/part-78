It took the author more than a decade to finalize the novel, which was inspired by his own teenage and youth experiences in a post-war Lithuania. The novel starts in 1948 and spans a decade until 1958. It is well know that the Second World war finished in 1945, but it is a lesser known fact that the end of WWII was barely the beginning of the Soviet aggression in the Baltic states. The subsequent guerilla war left thousands of people dead, injured or expelled. Four friends try to survive under this new brutal communist government without betraying what they believe in. \n\nThe novel is written in Lithuanian language.\n\nIstorinis romanas &quot;Sutrypti metai&quot; - zurnalisto ir rasytojo Vytauto Baciaus \ndesimtmeti rasytas kurinys, vaizduojantis tragiskus pokario Lietuvos vykius 1948-1958 metais.
