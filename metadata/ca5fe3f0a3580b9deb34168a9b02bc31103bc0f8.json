In this world, dragons control both nature and the climate; therefore, they are worshiped by both humans and humanoids as the guardians of the world. Because of their significance, elite knight corps known as dragoons protect the dragons from harm. The story begins in the year that Valen graduates from the dragoon school. A mysterious black dragon suddenly appears and begins destroying the kingdom that Valen resides in. The dragoneers fight back, but are powerless against the black dragonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fearsome strengths. Valen, who survives the attack, is ordered to protect the elemental dragons and find out what the monster is after. Now Valen must trust and fight together with brave warriors he meets during his journey.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca5fe3f0a3580b9deb34168a9b02bc31103bc0f8","amp;dn":"Dragoneers+Aria%5BUSA%5D%5BPSP%5D%5BEnglish%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca5fe3f0a3580b9deb34168a9b02bc31103bc0f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,95,227,240,163,88,11,157,235,52,22,138,155,2,188,49,16,59,192,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
