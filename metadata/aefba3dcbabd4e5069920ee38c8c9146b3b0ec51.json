Miraculously appearing unhurt at the base later, he is given sodium amethol, but authorities are skeptical of his story that he was captured by aliens determined to conquer the Earth with giant monsters and insects. Martin vows to use existing technology to destroy them.\n\nPeter Graves stars in a very early roll.\n\nDr. Martin is played by Peter Graves.\n\nOtherwise, his voice will drive you crazy, because Peter Graves has a very particular inflection, cadence, and speech pattern, and you would be wondering who the heck that young dude is.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aefba3dcbabd4e5069920ee38c8c9146b3b0ec51","amp;dn":"Killers+from+Space+-+1954","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aefba3dcbabd4e5069920ee38c8c9146b3b0ec51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,251,163,220,186,189,78,80,105,146,14,227,140,140,145,70,179,176,236,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
