It burns five       \n         times hotter than the surface of the sun. And it can strike   \n         you dead pretty much out of the blue. Thirty million volts    \n         of electricity colliding with the human body are enough       \n         to stop your heart, zap your memory, and change your          \n         personality. Following the stories of lightning victims -     \n         some recent victims, and others plagued with unusual long     \n         term consequences - we'll unravel the science behind one      \n         of nature's most mysterious phenomena. New discoveries        \n         in lightning science and revolutionary brain imaging          \n         technology reveal what really happens when it strikes the     \n         human body.
