The first 500 were originally uploaded by falco98. The rest were downloaded by me. Make sure to give credit to him as well as Randall Munroe, the original creator. Read new comics at xkcd.com every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Enjoy!\n\nAlso, when you are done downloading, please seed! It is a very small file, and my upload speed sucks (about 25 kbps max) so I can't be the only one seeding!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a72a355887939200871135010a8d6e068cf62b8f","amp;dn":"xkcd+1-750","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a72a355887939200871135010a8d6e068cf62b8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,42,53,88,135,147,146,0,135,17,53,1,10,141,110,6,140,246,43,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
