This movie portrays a humble insurance clerk (Jonathan Pryce) getting caught up in matters way over his head.\n\nThe music of Charles Guard is a big plus, likewise the shots of foggy streets and alleyways. The opening credits alone are worth the Pryce of admission.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4bd32373ee0205fbbb8c303c89bab2e9c95b62f5","amp;dn":"The+Man+from+the+Pru+%281990%29+Pryce+Massey+York","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4bd32373ee0205fbbb8c303c89bab2e9c95b62f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,211,35,115,238,2,5,251,187,140,48,60,137,186,178,233,201,91,98,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
