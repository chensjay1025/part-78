The plan works, and she gets to keep her job.\n\nWith the help from a friend (Cheryl Hines) -- and a &quot;baby bump&quot; stolen from a mannequin -- Thea fakes the pregnancy while she figures out her next move. In the meantime, her boss gets called out of town and his cute brother Nick (Luke Kirby) takes over. In an attempt to get an author to publish a book with the company, he brings Thea along to a meeting with the author. Thea convinces the author that they are the right &quot;home&quot; for her book. Nick then launches a new parenting division at the publishing company, and he wants Thea to be the editor. This results in a raise and promotion for Thea, as well as the beginning of a romantic relationship between her and Nick after breaking off her engagement with Miles (Aaron Yoo). She begins to enjoy her life to the extent that her &quot;pregnancy&quot; becomes real to her. In an attempt to get Thea to admit her lie, Emma, her little sister, (played by Bridgit Mendler) throws Thea a surprise baby shower. When Thea still doesn't admit the lie to her family, Emma destroys her pregnancy pillow in a fit of rage. Quickly, Thea grabs a balloon and leaves. Later that day, the author of the book is going to have a book reading, but her boss comes back a week early, and gets into an argument with Nick (which ends with Nick jumping on him, then Thea pulling them apart). After insulting Thea, she tries to go at him. Nick holds her back by the stomach, and her balloon pops, blowing her cover.\n\nIMAGENES &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img31.imageshack.us/img31/4390/laborpains.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img31.imageshack.us/img31/4390/laborpains.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img267.imageshack.us/img267/9990/20100613210955.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img267.imageshack.us/img267/9990/20100613210955.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img13.imageshack.us/img13/7842/20100613211023.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img13.imageshack.us/img13/7842/20100613211023.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img80.imageshack.us/img80/5599/20100613211105.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img80.imageshack.us/img80/5599/20100613211105.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img576.imageshack.us/img576/4756/20100613211152.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img576.imageshack.us/img576/4756/20100613211152.png&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee7f11b7672a6bf19e231e3bfd12f7631cfee146","amp;dn":"Labor+Pains++por+memitoxxx+etorrents.org+ingles%2Flatino+dvdfull","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee7f11b7672a6bf19e231e3bfd12f7631cfee146","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,127,17,183,103,42,107,241,158,35,30,59,253,18,247,99,28,254,225,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
