And at times the quality is very good.\nThis DVD contains all the songs played by KISS when they performed at the SECC except for 2 songs I'm An Animal and 100,000 Years.\n\nIf you were there at the SECC then this is something you're going to want to see. If you saw KISS play anywhere in the UK, you will also want to see this. This was a great show and any KISS fan will love this DVD.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/aamHJaacp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/aamHJaacp&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4468b475036d42e8f95f3d730c2938646ca4c21a","amp;dn":"kiss+sonic+boom+live","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4468b475036d42e8f95f3d730c2938646ca4c21a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,104,180,117,3,109,66,232,249,95,61,115,12,41,56,100,108,164,194,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
