Keep the music alive\n\nEnjoy!!!!! Please Seed.. \n\n*Once I have recieved Conformation that this file has been uploaded i will proceed to upload the nxt installment. Please leave feedback do not hit and run as there will be others that will be hoping to recieve these torrents*.\n\nIt has taken me well over 10yrs to aquire these albums and they have been sent to me from Davenport county in Florida. As I live In Northern Ireland I have found it very difficult to find any material by this group here on this Continent.\n\nPLEASE TAKE NOTE!!!!! There is a distinct possibility that most of Alabama's Albums have been discontinued and very soon very little material will be available.. So please be patient and seed so that every person gets this awesome collection. around 59 discs in total so it's well worth gettin your hands on it..\n\nMany Thanks \n\nFrank Mc Kay\t\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c09d998a1db028a487d8320f6596148fe6cd01f3","amp;dn":"Alabama+Folder+6","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c09d998a1db028a487d8320f6596148fe6cd01f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,157,153,138,29,176,40,164,135,216,50,15,101,150,20,143,230,205,1,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
