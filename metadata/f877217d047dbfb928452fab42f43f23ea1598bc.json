Everything is made\nto resemble what Final Fantasy XI was just before the ToAU\nexpansion. Now that I have most of the bugs ironed out, the\nserver is making it's public debut.\n\nThe game server is a virtual machine for easy scalability and\nbackup purposes. The VM server has 2x quad core xeon processors\nat 2.53ghz, 16gb DDR2 fully buffered ram, the OS is on three\n500gb 7200rpm SAS drives in raid5, and the virtual machine is\non 2 180gb Intel enterprise SSD's in Raid0. Scripts back up\nthe virtual machine to a seperate server nightly. A fallback\nserver exists in the event of hardware failure that mirrors\nthe game server.\n\nSo join us, for free CoP era FFXI fun.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://nasomi.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://nasomi.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f877217d047dbfb928452fab42f43f23ea1598bc","amp;dn":"Final+Fantasy+XI+Free+Private+Server","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f877217d047dbfb928452fab42f43f23ea1598bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,119,33,125,4,125,191,185,40,69,47,171,66,244,63,35,234,21,152,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
