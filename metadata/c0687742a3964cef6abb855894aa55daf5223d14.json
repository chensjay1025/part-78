When he was unmasked in 1979 by the then new Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher as having been a Soviet spy and KGB recruiter (he was given immunity from prosecution on 1963) his world fell apart.\n\nIn this fascinating drama written and performed by Corin Redgrave, Blunt looks back over recent events. A beautifully crafted piece of theatre.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0687742a3964cef6abb855894aa55daf5223d14","amp;dn":"Blunt+Speaking.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0687742a3964cef6abb855894aa55daf5223d14","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,104,119,66,163,150,76,239,106,187,133,88,148,170,85,218,245,34,61,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
