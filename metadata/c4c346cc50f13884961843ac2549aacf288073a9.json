It reached number 2 in the U.S. charts. On the album inner sleeve, Christopher Cross dedicated this song to Lowell George, formerly of the band Little Feat, who died in 1979. It features soaring backing vocals by Michael McDonald and a soaring guitar solo by Cross himself.\n\nAccording to an interview by Guitar 2001 Magazine with guitarist Eric Johnson, he mentioned performing on &quot;Ride Like the Wind&quot;, but his parts did not make the final cut of the song. Johnson performed the guitar solo on the song &quot;Minstrel Gigolo&quot;.\n\nThe song was also covered by Freddie Hubbard on his 1982 album 'Ride Like the Wind', as well as by Taka Boom on her 1983 album 'Boomerang', as well as by British heavy metal band Saxon on their 1988 album Destiny and by American heavy metal band Speeed on their 1999 album Powertrip Pigs.\n\nCross performed the single live at Flemington Racecourse, Victoria, Australia, as part of the pre-race entertainment for the 2007 Melbourne Cup. In 2009 Cross performed the song on Late Night With Jimmy Fallon with the house band The Roots and special guest Michael McDonald doing the background vocals.\n\nSee my other Torrents: &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/user/Iron_Horse/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/user/Iron_Horse/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4c346cc50f13884961843ac2549aacf288073a9","amp;dn":"Saxon+-+Ride+Like+The+Wind","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4c346cc50f13884961843ac2549aacf288073a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,195,70,204,80,241,56,132,150,24,67,172,37,73,170,207,40,128,115,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
