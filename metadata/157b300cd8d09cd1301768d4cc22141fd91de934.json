Like a pre-emptive bolt of truth from the ancestors, SmileyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s PBS special ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMLK: A Call to ConscienceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ begins the anniversary week of Dr. Martin Luther King JrÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s assassination with a focus on the April 4, 1967 speech that marked his definitive break with President Lyndon Johnson and U.S. imperial wars. [b]Any sane and honest person exposed to the magnificent reasoning of Dr. KingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBeyond Vietnam: A Time to Break SilenceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ address, would forever recoil at comparisons between the martyred champion of peace and human rights and the incumbent imperial warlord and Wall Street Lord Protector, Barack Obama.[/b] Hopefully, Tavis SmileyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s timely intervention with the scheduled airing of the program on Wednesday, March 31, will inoculate viewers from the howling King-Obama nonsense that has polluted the slain leaderÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s birth and death days since the onset of the Obama phenomenon.\n...\n[b]We hear Dr. KingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s indictment of the United States that has held true for 43 years: that it is ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthe greatest purveyor of violence in the world today.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½[/b] In the presence of that voice and those words, who can escape the reality that Barack Obama is today engorged in unfathomable violence like no other human on the face of the Earth? \n...\nIn truth, it is impossible to escape the radical meaning of Dr. KingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s pro-democracy, anti-war, anti-imperialist, and anti-rule-of-the-rich politics, unless one actively resists understanding KingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s voluminous writings and speeches. [b]Only through a willful or imposed ignorance can one arrive at the conclusion that Martin Luther King and Barack Obama could in any way be found on the same side of history. The commander-in-chief of the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œgreatest purveyor of violence in the world todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ cannot be an ally of peace, or of social and economic justice.[/b][/quote]\n\n[url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/03/opinion/03herbert.html?pagewanted=all]Bob Herbert, New York Times - We Still DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Hear Him[/url]\n\n3) Some very astute comments in response to [url=http://www.tinyrevolution.com/mt/archives/002643.html]a post at A Tiny Revolution:[/url]\n\n[quote]The problem is not so much that power corrupts, although undoubtedly it does, but that the kind of people who gravitate towards it, are, even before they have any, the ones we need to keep an eye on. I think Frank Herbert once said something to that effect, probably better than I just did.\n\nPosted by: tiffa hancock at October 21, 2008 01:55 PM[/quote] \n\n[quote]'Power attracts pathological personalities. It is not that power corrupts but that it is magnetic to the corruptible. Such people have a tendency to become drunk on violence, a condition to which they are quickly addicted.' Frank Herbert - Chapterhouse Dune.\n...\n    \nPosted by: tim at October 21, 2008 03:33 PM[/quote] \n\nAnd morereflections by Arthur Silber[/url] on power, and on the narcissistic, sociopathic personality which voluntarily pursues the kind of power that the head of the American imperial state offers, with its mass-murdering machinery of empire, war and death:\n\n[quote]Reflect for just a moment about what it is they want to win so desperately. Each of these three persons [McCain, Obama and Clinton] wants to be the most powerful ruler in the world. Given the nature of the weapons that will be at their disposal, they want to be the most powerful ruler in all of history, with the power to fundamentally transform human history and perhaps even to end it in significant part. Even if you believed that you acted righteously, with justice and truth on your side (let us set aside for the moment how one can believe that the power to murder millions of innocent people can ever be thought to be right or just, although I do not believe such considerations should ever be set aside), would [i]you[/i] want power of that kind? If you would, I hope never to meet you. For any person who actively seeks the power of life and death over just one other human being, let alone [i]millions[/i] of people, is deeply, irrevocably damaged in psychological terms. If we use the term &quot;normal&quot; to designate those goals and motives that can generally be described as supportive of individual life and happiness, no one who wants to be president of the United States is remotely close to normal. When you consider the years of relentless, soul-destroying ambition that are required to approach the office of president, together with the indefensible compromises, the endless lies, and the constant exercise of power over others in less extreme forms, anyone who deeply desires to be president verges on a constant state of insanity.\n\nYet one of these terrifyingly deranged people will, in fact, be the next president. Many Americans are excited, even thrilled, about the prospect, which tells you a rather important fact about most Americans, actually many important facts. I have numerous reasons for dreaming of a stateless world. There are others, but these are among the most critical of them.[/quote]\n\n[url=http://www.chris-floyd.com/component/content/article/1-latest-news/1886-miraculous-organ-blair-obama-and-the-narcissists-defense.html]Chris Floyd - Miraculous Organ: Blair, Obama and the Narcissist's Defense[/url]\n\n[url=http://prorev.com/2008/11/can-we-talk-about-real-obama-now.html]Sam Smith - Can We Talk About The Real Obama Now?:[/url]\n\n[quote]...\nObama himself took his vaunted experience in community organizing and turned its principles on its head. [b]Instead of empowering the many at the bottom, he used the techniques to empower one at the top: himself.[/b]\n\nIt is historic that a black has been elected president, but we should remember that Obama was not running against Bull Connor, George Wallace or Strom Thurmond. [b]Putting Obama in the same class as earlier black activists discredits the honor of those who died, suffered physical harm or were repeatedly jailed to achieve equality. Obama is not a catalyst of change, but rather its belated beneficiary.[/b]\n\n[b]The key issue that has driven Obama throughout his career has been Obama.[/b] He has achieved virtually nothing for any other cause. His politics reflects whatever elite consensus he gathers around himself. This is why his &quot;post partisanship&quot; needs to be watched so carefully.[/quote]\n\n4) [url=https://onebigtorrent.org/torrents/7857/Howard-Zinn-You-Cant-Be-Neutral-on-a-Moving-Train-2004]Howard Zinn: You Can't Be Neutral on a Moving Train (2004)[/url]\n\n\n5) [url=http://www.voltairenet.org/article163443.html]The US and China: One Side is Losing, the Other is Winning by James Petras[/url]\n\n-----\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:157b300cd8d09cd1301768d4cc22141fd91de934","amp;dn":"PBS+Tavis+Smiley+Reports+-+MLK%3A+A+Call+to+Conscience","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"157b300cd8d09cd1301768d4cc22141fd91de934","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,123,48,12,216,208,156,209,48,23,104,212,204,34,20,31,217,29,233,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
