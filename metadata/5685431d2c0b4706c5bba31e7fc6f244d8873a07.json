For the\nmost up-to-date list of supported hardware, see the Hardware\nCompatibility List at the Microsoft Web site \n(http://www.microsoft.com/). In addition, print and read the \nfollowing files located in the docs folder on your Windows XP \ncompact disc (CD):\n\n   * Setup instructions \n\n   * Release notes (relnotes.htm), important compatibility and \n     postinstallation information.\n\nNew features are described in detail in Windows XP Help and Support\nServices. To open Help and Support Services, after completing Setup,\nclick Start, and then click Help and Support.\n\n======================================================================\n2.0 System Requirements for Installation \n======================================================================\n\nFor the full list of system requirements, see the Setup instructions\nfor your operating system referenced in the readme.htm file on your\nWindows XP CD.\n\n======================================================================\n3.0 Preinstallation Notes\n======================================================================\n\nBefore you install Windows XP on your computer, be sure to read this\nsection. This section contains information about issues that affect\nthe installation process. By using this information to perform your \ninstallation, you can ensure that the installation process proceeds \nsmoothly and that Windows XP functions correctly.\n\n3.1 Windows Product Activation (WPA)\n======================================================================\n\nProducts: Windows XP Home Edition, Windows XP Professional only\n\nIf you are prompted to activate your installation of Windows XP, defer\nactivation until you have completed planned upgrades or changes to\nyour computer's FIXED hardware and their device drivers. Otherwise,\nyou may need to reactivate after making such changes. FIXED \nhardware/drivers include the first instance of devices such as\nvideo, network (excluding modems), SCSI, hard drives, CD-ROM/DVD, and\nsystem memory. USB or other removable devices (such as cameras and\nprinters) do not affect activation.\n\n3.2 Using Passwords \n======================================================================\n\n3.2.1 Password Backup Disk\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nProducts: Windows XP Home Edition, Windows XP Professional only\n\nIf you created a password backup disk for a previous version of\nWindows, this process has changed. Re-create your password backup disk\nfor Windows XP.\n\n3.2.2 Restrictions on the Use of Blank Passwords\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWindows XP has a new default security feature that helps protect users\nwith blank passwords from network-based attacks. Users who do not \npassword-protect their accounts can only log on at their physical \ncomputer console: the monitor, keyboard, and mouse that is physically \nconnected to their computer. This restriction only applies to local \nuser accounts, not to domain user accounts.\n\nCaution: If your computer is not in a physically secured location, you\nshould assign strong passwords to all local user accounts. Failure to\ndo so allows anyone with physical access to the computer to log on\nusing a user account that does not have a password. This is especially\nimportant for portable computers, which should always have strong\npasswords on all local user accounts.\n\n3.3 Software Compatibility Issues \n======================================================================\n\n3.3.1 Message Queuing\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nProducts: Windows XP Home Edition only\n\nMessage Queuing is not supported on Windows XP Home Edition. If you\nare upgrading from Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows Millennium\nEdition computers running MSMQ version 1.0, consider upgrading your\ncomputer to Windows XP Professional.\n\n======================================================================\n4.0 Copyright\n======================================================================\n\nThis document provides late-breaking or other information that\nsupplements the Windows XP documentation.\n\nInformation in this document, including URL and other Internet Web\nsite references, is subject to change without notice and is provided\nfor informational purposes only.
