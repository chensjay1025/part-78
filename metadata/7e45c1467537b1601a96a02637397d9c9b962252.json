Launched in 2004 and hosted by comedian Rick Mercer, the weekly half-hour show combines news parody, sketch comedy, visits to interesting places across Canada, and satirical editorials, often involving Canadian politics. The show's format is similar in some respects to satirical news shows like Mercer's prior series, This Hour Has 22 Minutes, and to Jon Stewart's The Daily Show Ã¢â‚¬â€œ however, the Mercer Report's on-location segments are usually played relatively straight in comparison to those on the other shows, since participants are usually aware of Mercer's identity and purpose.\n\n\n\n\nCappers Notes:\nHere is the complete season 10, which aired from September 2012 - April 2013 (20 episodes).\nIt's been renewed for a season 11! :)\n\n\n\n--- File Information ---\nFile Name : Rick.Mercer.Report.S10E20.2013-04-02.HDTV.x264-CLDD.mp4\nFormat : MPEG-4 at 1 389 Kbps\nLength : 217 MiB for 21mn 52s 192ms\n\nVideo #0 : AVC at 1 215 Kbps\nAspect : 720 x 404 (1.782) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0 : AAC at 169 Kbps\nInfos : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage : en\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e45c1467537b1601a96a02637397d9c9b962252","amp;dn":"Rick.Mercer.Report.Season.10.HDTV.x264-CLDD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e45c1467537b1601a96a02637397d9c9b962252","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,69,193,70,117,55,177,96,26,150,160,38,55,57,125,156,155,150,34,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
