Robert Palmer from THE NEW YORK TIMES writes &quot;Miss Lunch was always an effective vocal performer. \n\nBut rock has grown complacent again -- even the underground rock that has borrowed so much from Miss Lunch's various bands over the years. Perhaps it's time for her to administer it a few more rude shocks.\n\nFeaturing footage from TEENAGE JESUS &amp; 8-EYED SPY, VH is an indispensible compendium &amp; cornerstone; approx 70:00, Dolby 5.1, photo gallery feature, PLUS complete disc/film/bibliographies.\n\nTrack Listing: \n\n*TEENAGE JESUS AND THE JERKS \nOrphans\nI Woke Up Screaming\nFreud in Flop\nRace Mixing\nBaby Doll\nInstra-mental\n\n*8-EYED SPY\nSorry for Behaving so Badly\nInnocence\nBoy Girl\nMotor Oil Shanty\nSwamp\nRun Through the Jungle\n\n*SHOTGUN WEDDING:\nBlood Is Just Memory\nCisco Sunset\n\n*ROWLAND S.
