Now, BP will be trying to figure out whether or not they can get a tight enough seal on the sheared pipe to cap it and start siphoning the oil onto a tanker. While we all hope for the best, some experts are saying that the gushing could last through Christmas, or even for years.\n\nJust days after BPÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s CEO saying that heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d like his life back and then admitting to a British newspaper that the company ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œdid not have the tools you would want in your tool-kitÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, BP has launched a new nauseating PR offensive with a series of TV ads (video below).\n\nMeanwhile, BP tells contractors that they donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t want any photos taken of the mounting animal carcasses and reporters are being escorted away by police who say that theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re taking orders from the company (more). Republicans continue to put their love for Big Oil ahead of the country ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ little wonder given that theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve received 75% of the oil &amp; gas campaign contributions made since 1990. And is it time to nuke the well? No, no itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not.\n\nArizona Governor Jan Brewer meets with Barack Obama today to discuss immigration, but the stateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s own Attorney General will not be in attendance because of his opposition to their inane new anti-immigrant law. Speaking of which, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s looking more and more like ArizonaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s new laws are simply designed to secure cheap labor for employers for years to come.\n\nAlso today, a bad call costs a Detroit TigerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s pitcher a perfect game - after consideration MLB will let the call stand. Are the GoreÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s just part of a growing Baby Boomer late-stage divorce trend? And the number of teens relying on the rhythm method for birth control is on the rise.\n\nThese stories, your calls, and much more on todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Randi Rhodes Show!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a5d364547629b7b2ac7e213f6750bd133dae629","amp;dn":"Randi+Rhodes+Show+-+June+03+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a5d364547629b7b2ac7e213f6750bd133dae629","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,93,54,69,71,98,155,123,42,199,226,19,246,117,11,209,51,218,230,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
