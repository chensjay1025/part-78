I recommend \n      and have used one system for years - CoreCodec for H264 (&quot;Deblocking&quot; set to\n      &quot;Standard&quot;) and part of DivX7 for AAC. \n      Both are proved perfect, fastest and provide seamless playback up to 1080p \n      on new generation of computers. Newer NVIDIA graphic cards processors (GPU)\n      decode H264 using dedicated subroutines directly served from CoreCodec \n      (I have an ATI card, just in case you were wondering).\n      \n      Problems one can have may come from either one of the following \n      and/or a combination of these ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the playback system itself, a \n      malfunctioning device or lack of knowledge. \n      \n      For instance, any so called &quot;jerky&quot; playback of &quot;system-heavy&quot; 720p comes\n      from insufficient CPU and graphic engine power or simply - overloaded \n      computer. Use of ddshow filters and &quot;codecs&quot; is suicidal. This is not \n      Russian 720p Matroska format (&quot;official&quot; 720p) and completely different \n      setup is required (extremely high bit-rates of .mkv 720p to some extent\n      &quot;hide&quot; bad encoding style). In low bit-rate H264, such as mine, \n      those errors and bad technique cannot be hidden and therefore are avoided as \n      much as possible.\n        \n      Any 'blurriness' of video comes from less-than-recommended media player. \n      VLC  and a few other players are the most versatile and, generally speaking,\n      good - but quality is 10-20% lower.\n      Any ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“blockinessÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ comes from 'system-too-slow' situation, when decoding \n      engine of ones device become over-capacitated and cannot process all frames \n      as it supposed to.\n      On &quot;I have no video&quot; and &quot;I have no sound&quot; I don't waste my time as this \n      is generally a complete lack of knowledge and/or understanding. \n      RTFM is the best response I can give.\n\n      MP4 is absolutely ISO 14496-1 compliant. There are no B-frames, no CABAC \n      entropy in 272p and 360p, no strange filtering and no AV weirdness of \n      any kind.\n\n      Recommended resolution for computers is 1024x768 (no matter frame-size).\n      PS3 + HDMI cable + newer TV have been reported as best combination.\n      I am very proud on sound quality and hence I recommend use of stereo system \n      and proper loudspeakers (connect Line Out of Soundcard or standalones \n      with Line In of any Stereo rack).\n      \n      I encode H264 for six years and I have experienced (first-hand) any problem \n      one might have or imagine. I have heard almost every ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“complaintÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ out there \n      and would, if asked POLITELY, be happy to answer questions and give as much \n      help as humanly possible   \n      I always have.\n \n NOTE: I have encoded 272p (381 MB) version too. But, I am not sure that size \n       difference is so big factor in this specific case (long movie, 16/9 aspect\n       ratio, visually very good).\n       Anyhow, if more than few are interested, let me\n       now right here and I ''ll try to up 272p soon as possible.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e01768c7458f4a7c109d94d7b8a1d45b82e2c41","amp;dn":"Remember.Me.2010.BluRay.PROPER.720p.H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e01768c7458f4a7c109d94d7b8a1d45b82e2c41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,1,118,140,116,88,244,167,193,9,217,77,123,138,29,69,184,46,44,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
