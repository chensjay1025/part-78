Reading them as individual jpegs is a royal pain in the ass IMO so I felt I needed to do something about it.\n\nSo what IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve done here is convert all the chapters from individual jpegs into pdfs. I didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do the original work of translating or scanning, just converted them. Some of the pages that were two-page spreads in the manga are sideways to the rest of the document because of the way they were originally scanned. I didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have time to fix each individual sideways page due to time constraints. \n\nIf youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d like to take the time to rotate the sideways pages yourself, I can highly recommend PDFill to do pages individually. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a free program that allows you to edit PDFs in many different ways. Powerful and useful: http://www.pdfill.com/\n\nNaruto chapters from 1 to 633 are included in this torrent. Please reseed and enjoy!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1c4dc9097d9b06d054d92b4830a059a3b2bec8e","amp;dn":"Naruto+Manga%2C+Chapters+1-33%2C+Ereader+Ready","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1c4dc9097d9b06d054d92b4830a059a3b2bec8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,196,220,144,151,217,176,109,5,77,146,180,131,10,5,154,59,43,236,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
