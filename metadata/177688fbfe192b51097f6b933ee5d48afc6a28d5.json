No one could have guessed that she had become another girl's 'perfect' victim. Happy. Beautiful. Talented. She had everything her killer could want.\nPerceived by crime experts everywhere as one of the most bizarre homicides they had encountered, Perfect Victim recounts two stories: Rachel's mother Elizabeth Southall tells of her family's heart-rendering experience Ã¢â‚¬â€œ how they lived through unimaginable tragedy, going to extraordinary lengths to prove their daughter wasn't a runaway. Criminal court reporter Megan Norris provides another side of the picture; the analysis, the astonishment of professionals when faced with the killer's weird and unsettling letters, and the police proceedings that led, eventually, to the Rachel Barber case being solved.\nConfronting and compelling, this is an incredible story about a callous and calculated crime.\n\nPlease seed and rate the torrents I upload. Go to kobobooks.com and choose books that you want uploaded and request them in the comments.\nNote: Comics on that site are in some weird ass format that only works on iOS and Android. To get those I have to go through the tired process of screen shots of each page, then create a word file, then convert to epub. Its a pain because even then the images may not show up right on some devices/apps.\n\nSupport Amas school of technology. The only school of its kind in an entire 3rd world country that doesn't force poor people to pay.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:177688fbfe192b51097f6b933ee5d48afc6a28d5","amp;dn":"Perfect+Victim","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"177688fbfe192b51097f6b933ee5d48afc6a28d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,118,136,251,254,25,43,81,9,127,107,147,62,229,212,138,252,106,40,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
