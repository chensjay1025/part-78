It was anything but stable, but I though it may be interesting to install it in an emulator. As for the emulator itself, SheepShaver, another torrent or website may help you. This is a 64MB disk image of MacOS 8.2, with only kilobytes of space left. I suggest making another &quot;Main&quot; hard disk.\n\nSheepShaver setup guide: http://www.emaculation.com/doku.php/sheepshaver","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:732a4bc71ba0298186f8c484d42d19bb637ad178","amp;dn":"Mac+OS+8.2b+%28SheepShaver%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"732a4bc71ba0298186f8c484d42d19bb637ad178","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,42,75,199,27,160,41,129,134,248,196,132,212,45,25,187,99,122,209,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
