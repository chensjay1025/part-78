No one sane could tolerate such behavior.\n\n2nd: Exchange of the bytes (file-chunks) sometimes drops under 25%, what tells that even during the download people WONT to share with other peers. They keep their upload speed at minimum to lower the costs but cannot see that download, instead of, let say, 40 minutes, take four hours. Maybe is that something they need or are prepared to take.\n\n3rd: Seeding is incredibly and devastatingly low in numbers and slow - what is expected keeping in mind reasons 1. and 2. I cannot compare myself to god-forbid eztv - BUT - even &quot;un-trusted&quot; uploaders who JUST make torrents for already existing files (making of the torrent and upload take 40 seconds) and share multi-gigabyte files or criminally bad encodings get HUNDREDTHS of seeders, even thousands willing to seed a day, a week, a month. On contrary, my files stay without seeders (serious ones) or substantial number of - within dozen HOURS.\n\nSo, regarding all these factors, I obviously have been doing bad and unpopular torrents, no matter some of you may think. Time has passed - four months should be enough to &quot;re-discover&quot; my unfortunate move to TPB. \n\nI woke up almost every day at 3-4 AM just to start downloading sources.\nI encode EVERY SINGLE FILE which takes from one to seven hours PER FILE. \nI was here to help, discuss and talk with people.\nI pay 600 dollars JUST to have internet connection, what equals to 12 000$ if compared to US income of 20 000 bucks per year.\n\nNo moreÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ as I said on mininova &quot;from crumbs of kindness I can live&quot; but here and now I say &quot;even by eating crumbs I can live, but it should be at least a slice per day, no less, I am not demanding in that sense&quot;.\n\nBut, unfortunately, I am burned-out by all things said and such new and restrictive &quot;mode&quot; is my answer. I always have been one reflective and reactive character and that fact cannot be changed.\n\nSo, my work is in &quot;terminal&quot; phase, same as my illness, and I cannot spend my remaining days by doing and helping for/to &quot;wrong&quot; people/reasons. I won't.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4fa799bff0f1fec17b9fd8ed4e461d5feb313b53","amp;dn":"Human.Target.2010.S01E09.272p.HDTV.H264.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4fa799bff0f1fec17b9fd8ed4e461d5feb313b53","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,167,153,191,240,241,254,193,123,159,216,237,78,70,29,95,235,49,59,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
