The delicate peace is        \n    inadvertantly shattered when a group of new homesteaders lay down        \n    their stakes on the cattlemen's side of town, upsetting the delicate     \n    balance that had existed thus far and sparking an all-out war between    \n    the farmers, who want the land tamed and property lines drawn, and       \n    the cowboys, who want the prairies to be open for their cattle to        \n    roam.                                                                    \n                                                                             \n                                                                        \n                                                                    \n                                                         \n                           \n        \n              Currently looking for:             \n        \n                                                       \n                                                        \n                                                                       \n                                                                           \n               Do you feel ripped off by what you get in                    \n                exchange for your supply?
