As with the sequel to this\nouting, 1972's More Experience, the liner notes -- quoting both Hendrix and his\ncontemporary, Eric Clapton -- claim the material is from the February 18, 1969, concert,\nthough it is more likely that this is the second show that happened on February 24 of that\nyear. It is mere fragments of the program and should have been combined with the follow-up\nor other selections from the performance. Steven Roby's excellent book -Black Gold: The\nLost Archives of Jimi Hendrix refers to this album as having &quot;horrid sound quality on highly\nedited official recordings from this show.&quot; If one doesn't have the bootleg to compare, the\nalbum is quite listenable, though much too brief. &quot;We'd like to blast your eardrums one more\ntime,&quot; Jimi says during a lengthy tune-up prior to a title the producers call &quot;Smashing of the\nAmps&quot; -- which is actually the intro to &quot;Purple Haze&quot; mutating into a very brief &quot;Star Spangled\nBanner.&quot; The cut takes up one half of one side of this recording but delivers very little.\n&quot;Sunshine of Your Love&quot; is fun and &quot;Room Full of Mirrors&quot; is also a delight, at least\nperformance-wise, Hendrix acknowledging the presence of Chris Wood and Dave Mason of\nTraffic on the &quot;Smashing of the Amps&quot; segment -- though they aren't credited anywhere on\nthe album jacket. With the Experience Hendrix company releasing so much other high-quality\nmaterial, this one is definitely for the completists/fanatics.\n\n\n\n\n   1 - Little Wing - 03:20\n   2 - Voodoo Chile - 07:17\n   3 - Room Full Of Mirrors - 02:55\n   4 - Fire - 03:44\n   5 - Purple Haze - 03:04\n   6 - Wild Thing - 01:20\n   7 - Bleeding Heart - 05:29\n   8 - The Sunshine Of Your Love - 06:50\n   9 - Room Full Of Mirrors [Extended Version] - 08:15\n  10 - Bleeding Heart [Extended Version]\n  11 - Smashing Of The Amps - 08:36\n  12 - C# Blues [People, People, People] - 08:32\n\n\n\nPlaying Time.........: 01:05:45\nTotal Size...........: 360.73 MB\n\n\n[img]http://img63.imageshack.us/img63/989/37963846.gif[/img]\n\n\n\n\n    Mitch Mitchell - Drums, Cowbell\n\n    Noel Redding - Guitar (Bass)\n\n    Steve Gold - Producer\n\n    Jimi Hendrix - Guitar, Vocals\n\n    Dave Mason - Guitar\n\n    Chris Woods - Flute\n\n[img]http://leetleech.org/images/80710005470279634483.png[/img]\n[img]http://leetleech.org/images/99431539810173671442.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://leetleech.org/images/68182661089192751767.png[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:774eeb137b1c725bf89059bad6056ac02158cd6f","amp;dn":"Jimi+Hendrix+-+Experience+-+OST+-+1995+%5BEAC+-+FLAC%5D+%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"774eeb137b1c725bf89059bad6056ac02158cd6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,78,235,19,123,28,114,91,248,144,89,186,214,5,106,192,33,88,205,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
