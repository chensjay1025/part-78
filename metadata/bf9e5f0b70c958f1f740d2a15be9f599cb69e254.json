A Last Alliance of Elves and Men is formed to counter Sauron and during a battle on the foot of Mount Doom, Prince Isildur, son of the recently slain King Elendil, picks up his father's broken sword and slashes at Sauron's hand, separating him from the Ring and vanquishing his army. However, due to Sauron's &quot;life force&quot; being bound to the Ring, the Dark Lord is not completely defeated unless the Ring itself is destroyed, but Isildur refuses to do so. Sometime later, Isildur is ambushed and killed by orcs and the Ring is lost in a river. Thousands of years later, the Ring is claimed by the creature Gollum causing him to obsess over it. Finally, the Ring abandons Gollum and is found by Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit from the Shire.\n\nSixty-years later, following his 111th birthday party, Bilbo leaves the Ring to his nephew, Frodo Baggins. Meanwhile, the wizard Gandalf the Grey rides to Minas Tirith to search for answers regarding Bilbo's magic ring only to learn that it is, in fact, Sauron's One Ring. Gandalf returns to Bag End and tells Frodo to leave the Shire immediately with the Ring. Gandalf catches Samwise Gamgee eavesdropping by a window and decides to send him along with Frodo. Gandalf rides to Isengard to meet with Saruman the White who reveals to Gandalf that the NazgÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â»l, or Ringwraiths, have left Minas Morgul to capture the Ring and kill whoever carries it. Gandalf attemps to flee to warn Frodo, but Saruman, having already been corrupted to Sauron's cause, imprisons Gandalf atop his tower Orthanc.\n\nWhile traveling to Bree, Frodo and Sam are soon joined by fellow hobbits, Merry and Pippin. After encountering a Ringwraith on the road, they manage to reach Bree only to discover that Gandalf hasn't arrived. Instead, Frodo meets a man called &quot;Strider&quot;, a friend of Gandalf who agrees to lead them to Rivendell. They continue travelling and spend the night on the hill of Weathertop, where they are attacked by the NazgÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â»l. Strider fights off the Ringwraiths, but Frodo is grievously wounded with a morgul blade causing him to turn into a wraith. While chased by the NazgÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â»l, Frodo is taken by the elf Arwen to the Elven haven of Rivendell, and healed by her father, Elrond. Arwen also uses her magic to cut off the pursuing Ringwraiths at the Ford of Bruinen, summoning a surge of water that sweeps the Ringwraiths away.\n\nIn Rivendell, Frodo finds Gandalf, who explains why he didn't meet them at Bree and that he had escaped Orthanc and Saruman's clutches with the help of an eagle. Later, Elrond calls a council to decide what should be done with the Ring. Elrond warns against keeping the Ring in Rivendell for long, knowing that the Elven realm could come under attack from both Mordor and Isengard. The Ring can only be destroyed by throwing it into the fires of Mount Doom, where it was forged. Frodo volunteers to take the Ring to Mount Doom and is accompanied by his hobbit friends and Gandalf, as well as Strider, who is revealed to be Aragorn, the rightful heir to the throne of Gondor. Also travelling with them are the Elf Legolas, the Dwarf Gimli and Boromir, the son of the Steward of Gondor. Together they comprise the Fellowship of the Ring.\n\nThe Fellowship set out and try to pass the mountain Caradhras, but they are stopped by Saruman's wizardry. At Gimli's insistence, they decide to seek safety and travel under the mountain through the Mines of Moria. Frodo agrees, but while traveling through the mines, they are attacked by Orcs and a Cave Troll, and encounter a Balrog, an ancient demon of fire and shadow, at the Bridge of Khazad-dÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â»m. Gandalf confronts the Balrog on the bridge, allowing the others to escape the subterranean realm, but he falls with the creature into the abyss below. The group flees to the Elven realm of LothlÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³rien, where they are sheltered by its rulers, Galadriel and her husband Celeborn. That night, Frodo meets Galadriel, who tells him that it is his destiny to handle the Ring and ultimately destroy it. Before they leave, Galadriel gives Frodo the Phial of Galadriel, and the other members also receive gifts from them. Taking the straight path to Mordor, they travel on the River Anduin towards Parth Galen.\n\nAfter landing at Parth Galen, Boromir tries to take the Ring from Frodo, believing that it is the only way to save his realm. Frodo manages to escape by putting the Ring on his finger and vanishing. Aragorn encounters Frodo, but unlike Boromir, Aragorn chooses not to take the Ring. Knowing that the Ring's temptation will be too strong for the Fellowship, Frodo decides to leave them and go to Mordor alone. Meanwhile, the rest of the Fellowship are attacked by Uruk-hai, who Saruman had ordered to hunt down the Fellowship and take back the Ring. Merry and Pippin, realizing that Frodo is leaving, distract the orcs allowing Frodo to escape. Boromir rushes to the aid of the two hobbits, but is mortally wounded by the orc commander Lurtz. Before he can finish Boromir, Aragorn arrives and decapitates Lurtz after a swordfight. Boromir regrets having attempted to steal the Ring, but is forgiven by Aragorn before he dies. Merry and Pippin are captured, prompting Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas to begin their pursuit of the orcs with the intent of rescuing the hobbits, leaving Frodo to his fate. Frodo returns to the banks of the river and begins rowing across when Sam appears and swims out after Frodo, insisting to keep his promise to Gandalf to look after Frodo. Frodo accepts Sam's presence as together they continue their journey through the hills of Emyn Muil.\n\nGeneral Info:  \n\nFile Title:  The Lord of the Rings 1 - The Fellowship of the Ring\nFile Duration:  2h 58mn\nFile Size:  597 MiB\nOverall Bitrate:  468 Kbps\nFile Container:  MPEG-4\nContainer Profile:  Base Media\nVideo Track Count:  1\nAudio Track Count:  1\nText Track Count:  5\n\nVideo Info:  \n\nFormat:  AVC\nFormat Info:  Advanced Video Codec\nFormat Profile:  &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;d890b1bfb09894ebf6e9&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nStream Size:  510 MiB (85%)\nDuration:  2h 58mn\nBitrate(Nominal):  400 Kbps\nBitrate(Max):  2 618 Kbps\nResolution:  720 pixels x 304 pixels\nDisplay AspectRatio:  2.35:1\nFramerate Mode:  Constant\nFramerate:  23.976 fps\nScan Type(Interlaced):  Progressive\nEncode Application:  x264 core 93 r1542 5b86182\nEncoder Settings:  cabac=1 / ref=5 / deblock=1:0:0 / analyse=0x3:0x133 / me=esa / subme=8 / psy=1 / psy_rd=1.00:0.00 / mixed_ref=1 / me_range=24 / chroma_me=0 / trellis=1 / 8x8dct=1 / cqm=0 / deadzone=21,11 / fast_pskip=0 / chroma_qp_offset=-2 / threads=3 / sliced_threads=0 / nr=0 / decimate=1 / interlaced=0 / constrained_intra=0 / bframes=3 / b_pyramid=2 / b_adapt=1 / b_bias=0 / direct=3 / wpredb=1 / wpredp=2 / keyint=250 / keyint_min=25 / scenecut=40 / intra_refresh=0 / rc_lookahead=40 / rc=2pass / mbtree=1 / bitrate=400 / ratetol=1.0 / qcomp=0.60 / qpmin=10 / qpmax=51 / qpstep=4 / cplxblur=20.0 / qblur=0.5 / ip_ratio=1.40 / aq=1:1.00\n\nAudio Info:  \n\nFormat:  AAC\nFormat Info:  Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat Version:  Version 4\nFormat Profile:  LC\nLanguage:  English\nStream Size:  81.7 MiB (14%)\nDuration:  2h 58mn\nBitrate Mode:  Variable\nBitrate(Nominal):  64.0 Kbps\nBitrate(Max):  125 Kbps\nSample Rate:  48.0 KHz\nChannels:  2 channels\nChannel Positions:  Front: L R\n\nSubtitle Info:  \n\nLanguage: English, Dutch, Hungarian, Portuguese, Spanish\nFormat:  Timed text\nCodec ID:  tx3g\nDuration:  2h 50mn\nBitrate:  38 bps\nStream Size:  47.7 KiB (0%)\n\nScreenshots:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i18.photobucket.com/albums/b116/mattlb0619/tlotr-trilogy/TheLordoftheRings1-TheFellowshipoft.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i18.photobucket.com/albums/b116/mattlb0619/tlotr-trilogy/TheLordoftheRings1-TheFellowshipoft.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nCover: http://i18.photobucket.com/albums/b116/mattlb0619/tlotr-trilogy/2.jpg\n\nThe Lord of the Rings 2 - The Two Towers\n\nPlot:  \n\nIn the Mines of Moria, the wizard Gandalf the Grey battles the Balrog on the Bridge of Khazad-dum  in an attempt to allow the Fellowship of the Ring to escape. Gandalf is pulled down to the chasm by the demon; the Fellowship believes he is dead, but he continues to fight it while falling down into a lake in the depths of the Earth. Sometime later, the Hobbit  Frodo Baggins continues his journey with his loyal friend, Sam through the hills of Emyn Muil. One night, they are attacked by the the creature Gollum wishing to retrieve &quot;his precious&quot;. The Hobbits capture him, but Frodo understands the burden of the ring and takes pity on the creature. Realizing they are in need of a guide, Frodo persuades Gollum to lead them to the Black Gate of Mordor.\n\nIn Rohan, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are in pursuit of the Uruk-hai, who are on their journey back to Isengard grass with hobbits Merry and Pippin as captives. Meanwhile, King ThÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©oden, the king of Rohan, is being put in a trance by his steward, GrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­ma Wormtongue, who is secretly in the service of Saruman. Orcs and Wild Men of Dunland, incited by Saruman, are freely roaming the land, burning villages, massacring the people and destroying crops. Recently, the King's only son ThÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©odred fell victim to them, left mortally wounded in an ambush. ThÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©oden's nephew ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â°omer interrogates GrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­ma, labelling him a spy: however, GrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­ma banishes ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â°omer, &quot;on pain of death&quot;, for undermining his authority, and ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â°omer sets forth to gather the remaining loyal men of the Rohirrim and leave Rohan and in the meantime, ambush and kill all of the Uruk-hai thus allowing the two hobbits to flee into the forests of Fangorn. There, Merry and Pippin meet Treebeard, the oldest of the Ents of Middle-Earth.\n\nFrodo, Sam and Gollum traverse the Dead Marshes, evading an airborne Ringwraith who rides on a fell beast. When they finally reach the Black Gate, they find it shut and heavily guarded by Orcs. However, as they watch, an Easterling contingent arrives and the gate opens for them to enter. Sensing a chance, Frodo and Sam make ready to move. However, they are held back by Gollum, who confirms their fears of capture and insists that any attempt to get in via the Black Gate will only end with the One Ring returning to Sauron. He then reveals that there is another way into Mordor, hidden and unguarded. Sam is immediately suspicious, but Frodo gives him the benefit of the doubt, pointing out that he has remained loyal thus far.\n\nÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â°omer later encounters Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli in Rohan, who tells the group that there were no survivors of the battle the previous night indicating that the hobbits were accidentally slain. Upon arriving at the battle site, Aragorn picks up the tracks of the hobbits and the trio follows them into Fangorn. There they are approached and temporarily subdued by a wizard masked with shining white light. Initially fearing it is Saruman, the group are amazed when he reveals himself to be Gandalf reborn, now known as Gandalf the White. The quartet proceed to Edoras, where they exorcise Saruman's hold on ThÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©oden and banish Wormtongue. The now awakened ThÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©oden has to come to terms with both his son's death and the threat of Saruman. Rather than risk open war and further harm to his people, ThÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©oden decides to flee to Helm's Deep, a large stronghold in the Mountains. Gandalf realises that Helm's Deep's defences will not survive the Uruk onslaught that is surely to come. He leaves to find ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â°omer, promising to return within five days with the 2,000 banished riders. As they lead the people of Edoras to Helm's Deep, Aragorn and ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â°owyn, ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â°omer's sister, form a close relationship. Aragorn tells ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â°owyn that Arwen, whom he loves, is leaving Middle-Earth to be with her people in the Undying Lands. In the meantime, Wormtongue has fled to Orthanc and informs Saruman of a weakness in the outer wall of Helm's Deep, which Saruman and his army of 10,000 Uruk-hai plan to exploit. Saruman dispatches his army to Helm's Deep, ordering them to spare no one.\nThe 10,000 strong Uruk-hai besiege Helm's Deep.\n\nHaving led the Hobbits south from the Black Gate to the land of Ithilien, Gollum is in inner turmoil, torn between his loyalty to Frodo and his all-consuming need for the ring. The three travellers then play witness to an ambush of Southrons by Gondorian soldiers, who take Frodo and Sam prisoner. Meanwhile, on the journey to Helm's Deep, the Rohirrim are attacked by Saruman's Warg riders. During the battle, Aragorn is thrown off a cliff into a fast-flowing river below: Theoden, Legolas, Gimli and the others believe him dead and journey on to Helm's Deep. In Rivendell, Elrond comes to his daughter Arwen and implores her to leave on the ships departing Middle-Earth, escaping the troubles of these lands. When she refuses, Elrond, in a devastating speech, uses his powers of foresight and slowly tells her future if she chooses to remain in Middle-Earth with Aragorn. As he is mortal, even if he succeeds in defeating Sauron and becomes King of Gondor, Aragorn will die eventually and Arwen will be left to fade away with her grief when he is gone. Once again Elrond pleads with her and she yields to him. As she leaves Rivendell, the words of Galadriel, concerning the plight of Men to defy Sauron, come to Elrond in that moment. She questions whether the Elves should wash their hands of Middle-Earth and points out that the Ring has manoeuvred itself into the company of Men which it can easily corrupt. Galadriel asks if they should abandon Men to their fate, even if it condemns Middle-Earth to fall under Sauron's rule for all time.\n\nSurely enough, Frodo and Sam have been taken to Henneth AnnÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â»n, a stronghold for the Men of Ithilien, and brought before Faramir, the younger brother of Boromir. Gollum had eluded capture and, in order to save him from death at the hands of Faramir's hunters, Frodo accepts that he and Gollum are bound to each other. Faramir investigates further and learns of the One Ring that Frodo carries. Seeking to prove his worth to his father, Denethor, he decides the Ring shall go to Gondor. In Rohan, Aragorn washes up on the river bank and is nudged awake by the horse Brego, which formerly belonged to Theodred, and which Aragorn had set free before leaving Edoras. On the verge of collapse, he wills his horse to take him to Helm's Deep, passing Saruman's army of Uruk-hai on the way. His arrival at Helm's Deep is met with relief, but is short lived as the news of the strength of the approaching horde casts doubt upon the likely survival of the defenders. As night falls, a battalion of Elves led by Haldir, arrives from LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³rien, bearing word of alliance and aid from Elrond. In Fangorn forest, Merry, Pippin, Treebeard and other Ents hold a council to decide on the role of the Ents in the war with Saruman.\n\nThe battle of Helm's Deep begins with a flurry of arrows from the defending archers, cutting down dozens of Uruk-hai. Scaling ladders are thrown up against the Deeping Wall, and the Uruks swarm up to engage the defenders. At first the onslaught is stayed by the valour of the Rohirrim and of Aragorn and his companions. Suddenly, the gutter in the Deeping Wall is blown up by a crude explosive device Saruman has created, allowing the Uruks entry into the outer defences. Despite Aragorn's and Gimli's best efforts, the Uruk-hai manage to penetrate the main gate and soon the stronghold is overrun. In the midst of battle, Haldir is slain and the few remaining Elves fall back. In the Hornburg however, the Uruks have scaled the walls and have breached the gate, forcing the defenders to retreat into the Keep. In Fangorn, Treebeard and the other Ents have decided to not have any involvement in the war, deciding rather to &quot;weather such things as [they] have always done&quot;. Despite this, Pippin manages to cleverly take Treebeard to the section of Fangorn Saruman has recently decimated near Isengard. Treebeard is filled with rage at Saruman's betrayal and commands all the other Ents to seek vengeance. The Ents gather and embark upon 'the Last March of the Ents', straight into Isengard itself.\n\nMeanwhile, as ThÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©oden despairs in the besieged Keep, Aragorn refuses to give in and, remembering Gandalf's words before he left Edoras, he takes ThÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©oden, Legolas and the remaining Rohirrim on one last gallant ride to attack the Uruk-hai army in a desperate bid to allow the Rohirrim's women and children to escape into the mountains. The riders storm out of the Keep and cut their way through to the fortress gate. As the riders emerge into the mass of Uruks, the first rays of dawn fall down into the valley and upon the eastern hill, Gandalf appears, accompanied by ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â°omer and his men. They rush down into the body of the stunned Uruks and rout them: the terrifed Uruks flee into Fangorn, where the Ents and their Huorn allies swiftly exact retribution. Meanwhile, at Isengard the Ents are taking control. They destroy the remaining Uruk population and release the dam placed upon the river Isen, which gushes forth into the plains around Orthanc, drowning the surviving Orc defenders, quenching the fires of its industry and stranding Saruman in his tower.\n\nAway in the East, Faramir has had the hobbits bound and taken to Osgiliath, a ruined city on the banks of the river Anduin between Mordor and Gondor. There a small battle ensues with the Orcs of Mordor, who are led by a Ringwraith. With the help of Sam, Frodo narrowly escapes the Ringwraith's efforts to capture him and the Ring. In an inspired monologue, Sam reflects on the state he and Frodo are in, on how their story may yet come to have a happy ending, even when so much bad had happened. Frodo is doubtful of this, but Sam insists that they must still hold on to what they are fighting for: each other and the fulfilment of their quest. Approaching them from the throes of battle, Faramir overhears them and realises these unassuming hobbits have a high doom before them which he can no longer hope to interrupt. He sets them free and helps them on their way. Gandalf and the others now know that things have been set in motion that cannot be undone or avoided. Sauron will surely seek retribution for the defeat of his puppet Saruman and strike at Men again, only stronger and with greater fury: as Gandalf puts it &quot;The battle for Helm's Deep is over. The battle for Middle-Earth is about to begin&quot;. He remarks that hope now rests with Frodo and Sam, who have resumed their journey to Mordor with Gollum. Feeling betrayed by Frodo when he delivered him into the hands of Faramir's men, Gollum's darker self re-emerges and he decides to reclaim the ring by secretly leading Frodo and Sam to a creature he refers to only as &quot;her&quot;.\n\nGeneral Info:  \n\nFile Title:  The Lord of the Rings 2 - The Two Towers\nFile Duration:  2h 59mn\nFile Size:  600 MiB\nOverall Bitrate:  468 Kbps\nFile Container:  MPEG-4\nContainer Profile:  Base Media\nVideo Track Count:  1\nAudio Track Count:  1\nText Track Count:  3\n\nVideo Info:  \n\nFormat:  AVC\nFormat Info:  Advanced Video Codec\nFormat Profile:  &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;0e466769664e423d203f&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nStream Size:  513 MiB (85%)\nDuration:  2h 59mn\nBitrate(Nominal):  400 Kbps\nBitrate(Max):  2 076 Kbps\nResolution:  720 pixels x 304 pixels\nDisplay AspectRatio:  2.35:1\nFramerate Mode:  Constant\nFramerate:  23.976 fps\nScan Type(Interlaced):  Progressive\nEncode Application:  x264 core 93 r1542 5b86182\nEncoder Settings:  cabac=1 / ref=5 / deblock=1:0:0 / analyse=0x3:0x133 / me=esa / subme=8 / psy=1 / psy_rd=1.00:0.00 / mixed_ref=1 / me_range=24 / chroma_me=0 / trellis=1 / 8x8dct=1 / cqm=0 / deadzone=21,11 / fast_pskip=0 / chroma_qp_offset=-2 / threads=3 / sliced_threads=0 / nr=0 / decimate=1 / interlaced=0 / constrained_intra=0 / bframes=3 / b_pyramid=2 / b_adapt=1 / b_bias=0 / direct=3 / wpredb=1 / wpredp=2 / keyint=250 / keyint_min=25 / scenecut=40 / intra_refresh=0 / rc_lookahead=40 / rc=2pass / mbtree=1 / bitrate=400 / ratetol=1.0 / qcomp=0.60 / qpmin=10 / qpmax=51 / qpstep=4 / cplxblur=20.0 / qblur=0.5 / ip_ratio=1.40 / aq=1:1.00\n\nAudio Info:  \n\nFormat:  AAC\nFormat Info:  Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat Version:  Version 4\nFormat Profile:  LC\nLanguage:  English\nStream Size:  82.0 MiB (14%)\nDuration:  2h 59mn\nBitrate Mode:  Variable\nBitrate(Nominal):  63.9 Kbps\nBitrate(Max):  118 Kbps\nSample Rate:  48.0 KHz\nChannels:  2 channels\nChannel Positions:  Front: L R\n\nSubtitle Info:  \n\nLanguage: English, Croatian, Hungarian\nFormat:  Timed text\nCodec ID:  tx3g\nDuration:  2h 53mn\nBitrate:  34 bps\nStream Size:  43.2 KiB (0%)\n\nScreenshots:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i18.photobucket.com/albums/b116/mattlb0619/tlotr-trilogy/TheLordoftheRings2-TheTwoTowersmp4_.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i18.photobucket.com/albums/b116/mattlb0619/tlotr-trilogy/TheLordoftheRings2-TheTwoTowersmp4_.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nCover: http://i18.photobucket.com/albums/b116/mattlb0619/tlotr-trilogy/3.jpg\n\nThe Lord of the Rings 3 - The Return of the King\n\nPlot:  \n\nThe film begins with a flashback of how SmÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©agol recovered the One Ring, before forwarding to him as Gollum, taking Frodo and Sam to Minas Morgul. Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Gandalf, ThÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©oden  and ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â°omer  meet up with Merry, Pippin  and Treebeard  at Isengard, now under the Ents' control, where Gandalf concludes Saruman will pose no further threat. They also recover the palantÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­r  from the ruins. The group return to Edoras, where Theoden holds a feast in celebration of the victory at Helm's Deep. Pippin's curiosity gets the better of him at Edoras, and he looks into the palantÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­r, where he sees a vision of a white tree burning, as well as being seen and mentally interrogated by Sauron, though Pippin tells him nothing regarding Frodo and the Ring. From this, Gandalf deduces Sauron is planning to attack Minas Tirith, and he rides off there with Pippin. In the meantime, Arwen, on her way to the Undying Lands, has a vision of her son by Aragorn and convinces Elrond  to reforge the sword Narsil that cut the Ring from Sauron's finger long ago. Sam also overhears Gollum's treacherous plans to murder them and take the Ring for himself, but Frodo does not believe him. Gollum plays on this, trying to turn Frodo and Sam against each other.\n\nGandalf and Pippin arrive at Minas Tirith to find the steward Denethor mourning Boromir, and Pippin swears loyalty to him, as he owes Boromir a life debt for his heroic actions at Amon Hen. Gandalf warns Sauron is now ready to strike and urges Denethor to call Rohan for aid. Denethor refuses, knowing Aragorn is there, and fearing Aragorn and Gandalf plan to depose him. That night, Gandalf and Pippin witness a pillar of green fire rise from Minas Morgul, where the Witch-king sends off his army, heralding the start of the war. Frodo, Sam and Gollum also begin climbing the stairs nearby. The Morgul army, led by the NazgÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â»l, drives the Gondorians out of Osgiliath. Denethor, who has no love for his younger son, orders him out on a doomed ride to reclaim the city. Faramir and his brave knights are seemingly killed by the masses of Orcs waiting in the ruined city. In the meantime, Gollum convinces Frodo to send Sam home on the belief he wants the Ring. Fortunately, Pippin has begun the long line of beacon signals to Edoras, where Theoden and Aragorn lead the Rohirrim to Dunharrow for a muster. At Dunharrow, Legolas and Gimli learn the legend of the haunted mountain Dwimorberg, which overlooks the camp, from Eomer. Aragorn also meets Elrond, who informs him of what Arwen has done and warns him they are outnumbered by Sauron's army. Elrond presents Aragorn with the newly reforged AndÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âºril and tells him to brave the Paths of the Dead, where he may acquire the help of the cursed Army of the Dead, who owe allegiance to the Heir of Isildur. ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â°owyn tries to convince him not to go, confessing her love for him, but Aragorn -knowing Arwen has chosen her love for him over the immortal life of the elves- presses on. Together with Legolas and Gimli, Aragorn gains the loyalty of the King of the Dead and his men. The trio then capture the ships of the Corsairs of Umbar, who Sauron had intended to launch a surprise attack on Minas Tirith. At Dunharrow, ThÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©oden rides off to war with over 6,000 Riders, unaware ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â°owyn and Merry are part of the army too.\n\nThe Morgul army begins the siege of Minas Tirith, and many missiles are traded between Orc catapults and Gondorian trebuchets, whilst the Witch-king and the other Ringwraiths on their Fell Beasts wreak havoc on the city. In the middle night, they break into the city using the enormous battering ram Grond, and the defenders are forced to retreat as legions of Orcs, Trolls, and worse swarm into the city. At the same time Gollum betrays Frodo to the monstrous spider Shelob, but Sam returns to fight her off. Sam believes Frodo is dead and takes the One Ring, planning to complete the quest, but when Orcs from the Tower of Cirith Ungol take Frodo, he overhears that he is still alive. At Minas Tirith, Denethor falls into madness and prepares a pyre for him and the unconscious Faramir. Pippin warns Gandalf and together, they manage to save Faramir, though Denethor perishes by self-immolation. With much of the lower city aflame, Orcs advancing, and mounting losses, the Gondorians appear to be finished. As the sun rises, however, Theoden and the Rohirrim arrive and charge into the Orcs, trampling many of them underfoot and making an enormous dent in the besiegers' numbers. As the Orcs retreat away from Minas Tirith, Haradrim reinforcements, including huge numbers of MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â»makil and the Witch-king, arrive to engage them, and the Battle of the Pelennor Fields begins. The Rohirrim fight bravely in the face of the Haradrim and Orcs, but risk being destroyed before the Gondorians can move out from the city and aid them. In the midst of the fight, the Witch-king swoops down upon King Theoden, crushing him underneath his horse. Meanwhile, the Rohirrim are facing significant losses at the hands of the Mumakil when Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and the Dead finally arrive on the captured Corsair ships and counter-attack, routing the Orcs and MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â»makil, whilst ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â°owyn and Merry kill the Witch-king. The Gondorians fighting in Minas Tirith are freed, and the Rohirrim are able to escape annihilation. ThÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©oden passes away, and Aragorn holds the Dead Army's oath fulfilled, freeing them from their curse.\n\nSam rescues Frodo from the tower, mostly empty following a fight amongst the Orc garrison over the mithril shirt, and they begin the long trek to Mount Doom. Gandalf realizes that over 10,000 Orcs stand on the road between Cirith Ungol and Mount Doom, that would make Frodo's journey impossible. Aragorn leads all the men who survived the battle to the Black Gate to distract Sauron and to call out his armies. After a torturous journey through Mordor, Sam carries Frodo up to Mount Doom but Gollum attacks them, just as the Men of the West furiously battle the Orcs. Frodo, at the Crack of Doom, succumbs to the Ring's power. However, Gollum, who had secretly followed them, steals the Ring by biting off Frodo's finger that held the ring. They both fight to get it back and fall off the precipice. Frodo grabs the ledge but Gollum and the Ring fall into the pools of lava below. Sam rescues Frodo and the Ring is destroyed. The Tower of Barad-dÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â»r collapses, whilst Sauron, finally defeated, fades into nothing. The destruction of his form creates an immense shockwave that kills most of the Orcs; the rest perish as the whole of Mordor collapses into a gaping chasm, leaving the men of the West unharmed.\n\nFrodo and Sam are stranded until Gandalf arrives with the Eagles, and they awake in Minas Tirith, reuniting with their friends at long last. Aragorn is crowned King, heralding the new age of peace, and is reunited with Arwen. When Aragorn meets the hobbits who bow before him, he stops them and says &quot; You bow to no one&quot;. He and the whole of Minas Tirith bow to the Hobbits in honor of their heroics. The hobbits return home to the Shire, where Sam marries Rosie. But Frodo is dealing with the psychological trauma of being the Ring-bearer, and also pain and illness on the anniversary of his wounds, and he leaves Middle-earth with Gandalf, Bilbo, Elrond, Celeborn and Galadriel at the Grey Havens, leaving his account of the story to Sam, who peacefully continues his family life.\n\nGeneral Info:  \n\nFile Title:  The Lord of the Rings 3 - The Return of the King\nFile Duration:  3h 21mn\nFile Size:  673 MiB\nOverall Bitrate:  468 Kbps\nFile Container:  MPEG-4\nContainer Profile:  Base Media\nVideo Track Count:  1\nAudio Track Count:  1\nText Track Count:  3\n\nVideo Info:  \n\nFormat:  AVC\nFormat Info:  Advanced Video Codec\nFormat Profile:  &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;d79fbeb0bf979be4f9e6&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nStream Size:  575 MiB (85%)\nDuration:  3h 21mn\nBitrate(Nominal):  400 Kbps\nBitrate(Max):  2 267 Kbps\nResolution:  720 pixels x 304 pixels\nDisplay AspectRatio:  2.35:1\nFramerate Mode:  Constant\nFramerate:  23.976 fps\nScan Type(Interlaced):  Progressive\nEncode Application:  x264 core 93 r1542 5b86182\nEncoder Settings:  cabac=1 / ref=5 / deblock=1:0:0 / analyse=0x3:0x133 / me=esa / subme=8 / psy=1 / psy_rd=1.00:0.00 / mixed_ref=1 / me_range=24 / chroma_me=0 / trellis=1 / 8x8dct=1 / cqm=0 / deadzone=21,11 / fast_pskip=0 / chroma_qp_offset=-2 / threads=3 / sliced_threads=0 / nr=0 / decimate=1 / interlaced=0 / constrained_intra=0 / bframes=3 / b_pyramid=2 / b_adapt=1 / b_bias=0 / direct=3 / wpredb=1 / wpredp=2 / keyint=250 / keyint_min=25 / scenecut=40 / intra_refresh=0 / rc_lookahead=40 / rc=2pass / mbtree=1 / bitrate=400 / ratetol=1.0 / qcomp=0.60 / qpmin=10 / qpmax=51 / qpstep=4 / cplxblur=20.0 / qblur=0.5 / ip_ratio=1.40 / aq=1:1.00\n\nAudio Info:  \n\nFormat:  AAC\nFormat Info:  Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat Version:  Version 4\nFormat Profile:  LC\nLanguage:  English\nStream Size:  92.0 MiB (14%)\nDuration:  3h 21mn\nBitrate Mode:  Variable\nBitrate(Nominal):  64.0 Kbps\nBitrate(Max):  115 Kbps\nSample Rate:  48.0 KHz\nChannels:  2 channels\nChannel Positions:  Front: L R\n\nSubtitle Info:  \n\nLanguage: English, Croatian, Hungarian\nFormat:  Timed text\nCodec ID:  tx3g\nDuration:  3h 12mn\nBitrate:  27 bps\nStream Size:  38.1 KiB (0%)\n\nScreenshots:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i18.photobucket.com/albums/b116/mattlb0619/tlotr-trilogy/TheLordoftheRings3-TheReturnoftheKi.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i18.photobucket.com/albums/b116/mattlb0619/tlotr-trilogy/TheLordoftheRings3-TheReturnoftheKi.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf9e5f0b70c958f1f740d2a15be9f599cb69e254","amp;dn":"The+Lord+of+the+Rings+Trilogy+%5BH264-AAC%5D%5BBDRip%5D+%5Bmattlb0619%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf9e5f0b70c958f1f740d2a15be9f599cb69e254","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,158,95,11,112,201,88,241,247,64,210,161,91,233,245,153,203,105,226,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
