It retains a lot of the same sound quality, but has a very playful, slightly bizarre quality to the CD.  Very enjoyable, and highly recommended!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc9e83ec8286cfef71f77361f3546dbc2c02211f","amp;dn":"The+Wild+Band+of+Snee","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc9e83ec8286cfef71f77361f3546dbc2c02211f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,158,131,236,130,134,207,239,113,247,115,97,243,84,109,188,44,2,33,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
