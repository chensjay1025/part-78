FL9 is the\nfastest way from your brain to your speakers.\n\nWhat is FL9?\n\nFL Studio is a full-featured, open architecture, music production environment\ncapable of audio recording, composing,sequencing and mixing, for the creation of\nprofessional quality music. The FL Studio philosophy is creative freedom:\n\nFree your audio - Route any instrument to any mixer track. Each mixer track can\nreceive audio from any number of instruments, any number of other mixer tracks and\na soundcard input. Mixer tracks, in turn, can send audio to any\nnumber of other mixer tracks and a soundcard output. Create sub-mixes, effects\nchains or complex mixes. FL studioÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s flexible architecture sets audio free.\n\nFree your mind - Choose your preferred workflow, compose using the step-sequencer\nor piano roll. Create in pattern or track mode, then arrange your ideas in the\nfree ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“paletteÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Playlist. The Playlist presents timeline as a virtual ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“canvasÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢\nwhere each Playlist track can simultaneously hold any number of score, audio and\nautomation events. Now thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s freedom.\n\nPLUS:\n\nInstrument\n\nAudio Recording &amp; Editing\nSequencing\nArranging\nMixing &amp; Mastering\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nKey new features and changes:\n\nOver 370 additions, changes &amp; bugfixes featuring:\n\nSidechaining - The FL Studio Mixer 'Track Send' now has an\nadditional 'Sidechain' mode to support multiple-input mixer plugins.\n\nMulti-core CPU (Hyperthreading) - Improved multithreaded generator &amp; added multithreaded effects processing. \n\nMultiple controllers - Can now control multiple independent instrument channels, assigned by MIDI number.\n\nNew volatile linking feature. \n\nWrapper - Aligned tick lengths checkbox for greater plugin compatibility.\n\nRevised Playlist\n\nPlaylist track naming &amp; icon - Tools for better song organization. \nPlaylist track mute controls and more!\n\nNew plugins:\n\nOgun: synthesizer specialized in metallic timbres.\nGross Beat: beat rearranger effect.\nNew Autogun synthesizer based on Ogun.\n\nSakura:\nVocodex: vocoder effect.\n\nMaximus:\nHeavy weaponry for the loudness war\n\nMaximus will deliver transparent peak limiting and volume maximization without\ncoloration of the processed sound. However, Maximus is much more than a pristine\nquality Mastering Maximizer, it's also a Compressor,\nLimiter, Noise Gate, Expander, Ducker and De-esser. Maximus excels equally well as\na final mastering plugin or as a per-track effect. Lock and load.\n\nImplemented &amp; removed:\n\nRight-clicking playlist items no longer deletes them (hold halt to do so). (thrown, user complaints)\nCan now middle-click working area to &quot;pan&quot; plugin windows (ONLY plugins, as it's designed for oversized VST's)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6bfb93a3d7a25eae46a301bb728fe8c27bb2f0b","amp;dn":"FL+Studio+XXL+v9.0.0+%2BUN-LOCKER+%2BUN-LOCKED+VSTi+Las2h","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6bfb93a3d7a25eae46a301bb728fe8c27bb2f0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,191,185,58,61,122,37,234,228,106,48,27,183,40,254,140,39,187,47,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
