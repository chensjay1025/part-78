Dave Donovan\nDeborah Harry ... Thor Sturmundrang\nIan Maynard ... Spazz-O\nShelly Mars ... Andie\nRobert Occhipinti ... Chick\nRiz Fairchild ... Scratch\nTodd Anthony ... Dino\nShoshana Ami ... Bonnie\n\n\n\n\nThis comic caper pulls out all the stops in its story of a has-been shock rocker named Spazz-O, who is wasting so much of his limited wealth that his wife and manager, who are having an affair, plot to have him killed by a hitman. Before that can happen, he is kidnapped by a never-was rock group named Hindenberg who hold him for ransom.\n\nThis is the jumping off point for one of the craziest, most colorful and broad satires of the music scene you're likely to see for some time to come. It's basically O. Henry's THE RANSOM OF RED CHIEF updated to the 90s and cranked up to the max with every rock music cliche thrown into the mix. The script is very funny and the direction is colorful.\n\nSpecial kudos to Ian Maynard as the &quot;great&quot; Spazzo-O, the kind of guy who puts an air conditioner in his sauna because he's sweating in there. Anyone who knows the music business or is a fan of heavy metal will be especially tickled by the cameo appearances of some authentic rock stars. And that song, &quot;Inseminator&quot; is a hoot. Both it and the movie are destined for cult status.\n\nFile Name .....................: Drop.Dead.Rock.1996.DVDRip.XviD.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ..........: 1,127 MB (or 1,154,444 KB or 1,182,150,656 bytes)\nRuntime .......................: 01:34:01 (135,240 fr)\n\nVideo Info\nVideo Codec ...................: XviD\nFrame Size ....................: 576x432 (1.33:1) [=4:3]\nFPS ...........................: 23.976\nVideo Bitrate .................: 1480 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ................: 0.248 bits/pixel\n\nAudio Info\nAudio Codec ...................: ac3 (0x2000) Dolby Laboratories, Inc\nSample Rate ...................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate .................: 192 kb/s (96/ch, stereo) CBR \n\n\n\n...BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE!\n\nAlso included is the Making Of Featurette (18:28) and Spazzo's Inseminator Music Video (2:55).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5466a2bd144e8c8118adfd96bbe0b98c61180614","amp;dn":"Drop.Dead.Rock.1996.DVDRip%28Debbie+Harry%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5466a2bd144e8c8118adfd96bbe0b98c61180614","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,102,162,189,20,78,140,129,24,173,253,150,187,224,185,140,97,24,6,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
