All through its new method of creating wavetables: Multi-Cycle Wave Analyzing synthesis.Dominator employs the use of Frequency Dissonance in an effort to create Dubstep-style wobbles instead of the traditional use of the LFO (though one is also included).\nIt is intended for styles that include Dubstep, Drum Ã¢â‚¬ËœnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Bass, Electro, House, and Trance, Avant Garde and contemporary.\nFeatures:\n2x Main oscillators employing Multi-cycle Wave Analysing Synthesis (including 52 pre-analysed wavetables saved in HEX format ranging from simple to complex)\nEach containing:\nA Graphical ADSR Envelope for maximum precision.\nA Detune module incorporating Fine tuning, Semitone, and tone shifting.\nHigh precision Pitch-bend with an Octave range.\nMix level.\n2x Sub Oscillators (Sine, Sawtooth, Triangle, and square waveforms) making use of Frequency Dissonance.\nHigh Quality overdrive distortion including:\nSpace Type.\nFeedback.\nBi-quad filter.\nBitcrusher.\nLFO Module\nSaw, Sine, pulse, and random waveform presets.\nCustom waveform that can be drawn in and saved.\nThe Smooth tool controls the path of the signal through the LFO.\nOSC Phase control.\nOSC Filter Cut-off control.\nAutomatic DAW tempo Sync.\nSpeeds: 1/1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32, 1/64, 1/128.\nArpeggiator/Sequencer:\nStep based Arp which can double as a sequencer.\nAutomatic DAW tempo Sync.\nSpeeds: 1/1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32, 1/64, 1/128.\n2X Multi-mode Filters (dedicated to each OSC):\nTypes: LPF, HPF, BPF, BRF, PF.\nADSR controls for each filter.\nHigh Quality Sampler (independent from the main OSCs):\nSupports 44.1kHz, 16-bit WAV/OGG files.\nPitch follow function (subjective to the samples original pitch).\nMix level.\nStereo Chorus Module.\nCustomizable Digital Reverb Module.\nFlanger/Feedback Module.\nStereo Delay.\nUser customizable Preset Manager:\nLoad, Save individual presets or whole expansion packs.\nIncludes 135 factory installed presets (spread out into 3 packs).\nPresets marked with a Ã¢â‚¬Å“(FD)Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ after their name make use of Frequency Dissonance.\nOther features:\nDual Oscilloscopes for each Channel (L/R).\nSingle voice mode with Portamento (with variable time controls).\n32 voice polyphony mode.\nMain output level.\n\n-------------------\n\nInstallation instructions included in torrent","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a4ccc565297dfffad5333e3f23b566b83a6db32","amp;dn":"TA+Programming+DOMINATOR+synth+v1.04","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a4ccc565297dfffad5333e3f23b566b83a6db32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,76,204,86,82,151,223,255,173,83,51,227,242,59,86,107,131,166,219,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
