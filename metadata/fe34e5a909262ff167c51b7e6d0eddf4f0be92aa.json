He's a tough-guy, thinks-he's-funny, rock-music-playing, gourmet-cooking, painfully-moderate-drinking, hard-boiled man of the cloth. He is even available for a bit of romance, under the right circumstances.\n\nDoug Norstad, a member of Jonah Borden's church, is arrested for a vigilante killing. Norstad shares his true alibi with Borden, under the privileged status of religious confession. Knowing now that the man is innocent, Borden must prove it somehow, without divulging his secret. Along the way he uncovers a twisted series of murders and cover ups. Before it is all over, Borden himself has been bribed, beaten, shot, and arrested for murder. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe34e5a909262ff167c51b7e6d0eddf4f0be92aa","amp;dn":"Superior+Justice+by++Tom+Hilpert+-+Pulsate","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe34e5a909262ff167c51b7e6d0eddf4f0be92aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,52,229,169,9,38,47,241,103,197,27,126,109,14,221,244,240,190,146,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
