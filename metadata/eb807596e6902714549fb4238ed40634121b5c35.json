Admittedly, due to word of mouth from those who had attended earlier screenings of the film, my expectations for Clash of the Titans were fairly low. On top of that, many of the initial casting choices appeared to be somewhat suspect. So, what's my verdict? Well, I didn't hate itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦  \n\nThe plot of Titans is extremely straightforward ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ practically to a fault. Often, the film acts as though it's in a hurry, attempting to get from one action sequence to the next as quickly as possible. The scenes that occur in between each of these battles ultimately amount to nothing more than brief segments of exposition delivered by Perseus' &quot;guardian angel&quot; of sorts, Io (Gemma Arterton). So, while the film never really drags, it feels very soulless.\n\nAnd while we're on the subject of these action sequences, none of them end up being particularly memorable. About half of them are so frenetic to the point where they're almost disorienting - honestly, I'm glad that the 3D screenings were sold out this time 'round. On top of that, there's virtually no character development outside of Worthington's character (and even he isn't all that likable), so I never really cared about the outcome of these action sequences either. Also, as I mentioned earlier, my biggest fear with Titans was in regards to the acting, and thankfully, most of the cast do what's expected of them. Neeson's Zeus aside, none of the performances truly stand out, but they're nothing cringe-worthy either.\n\nUltimately, Clash of the Titans ends up being a forgettable piece of entertainment with a couple of gaping plot holes, hit-or-miss action sequences, and performances that fail to leave much of an impression. It's not horrible ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ just hollow.\n\nRelease Date: 2 April 2010 (USA)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb807596e6902714549fb4238ed40634121b5c35","amp;dn":"Clash+Of+The+Titans+%28Movie+Trailer%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb807596e6902714549fb4238ed40634121b5c35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,128,117,150,230,144,39,20,84,159,180,35,142,212,6,52,18,27,92,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
