This contains ALL THREE 1080p High Definition Trailers, HD screenshots from those trailers, and the trailer music from the latest trailer IN FLAC FORMAT!\n\nIncluded:\nALL THREE Inception Trailers in 1080p definition\nMind Heist by Zach Hemsey in FLAC format (song used in the new 3rd trailer...very Hans Zimmer + E.S. Posthumus-ish)\n\nEnjoy!\n\nAlso, I will be releasing a new Avatar Media Pack soon with more scans from magazines (I didn't release them earlier as my graphics card died and I couldn't photoshop them on my older PC) and a shrunken BluRay rip of the movie (not my personal rip).\n\n\n\nEDIT: Just realized the guy that authored the trailer music is actually spelled ZACK NOT ZACH, but since Zack is short for Zachary you can see my mistake.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af5c151bbf0b1d855d52fb6d792b52f11b462119","amp;dn":"Inception+Movie+MEDIA+PACK%21+HD+1080p+ALL+Trailers%21%2C+Trailer+Musi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af5c151bbf0b1d855d52fb6d792b52f11b462119","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,92,21,27,191,11,29,133,93,82,251,109,121,43,82,241,27,70,33,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
