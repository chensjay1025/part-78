In Bamiyan Buddha statues destroyed in thousands of families are struggling to survive. Bahtay, six year old Afghan girl wants to go to school following the example of a neighbor's son, who reads at the entrance to their cave. Having procured the money to buy the precious notebook and pencil instead of taking the mother's lipstick, Bahtay hits the road. On the way, she's been attacked boys who playing imitate adults and reproduce terrible violence ... The boys want to score a little girl with stones, blow it up, as the Taliban blew up a statue of the Buddha, to shoot her. Will Bahtay escape from these violent war games and get to school?\n\nExtras. Information: Hana Makhmalbaf, director. She was born in Tehran, Iran. 19 years. The daughter of the famous Iranian director Mohsen Makhmalbaf.\n\nThe director of the movie title:\n- I took this phrase from an article of his father, filmmaker Mohsen Makhmalbaf facing the European community, in which he states: &quot;A Buddha statue was not destroyed - she died of shame.&quot; Then, at the beginning of the XXI century, the Western public was indignant that the Taliban destroyed the ancient statue of Buddha in Bamiyan, but the same public for decades was not paying attention to how the Taliban destroyed the same people, millions of people. In my film, I wanted to say that human life is more precious than all the monuments of culture and even shrines. The action of my film is also taking place in Bamiyan, near the ruined shrines of Buddha.\n\nOperator: Ostad Ali (Ostad Ali)\nScenario: Marzieh Makhmalbaf (Marzieh Makhmalbaf)\nComposer: Tolibon Shahidi (Tolibhon Shakhidi)\n\n\n\n\nFrom:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.suninmind.cn/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.suninmind.cn/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://u8881.com/discuz/viewthread.php?tid=522511&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://u8881.com/discuz/viewthread.php?tid=522511&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c17c1ae09f907d5219fe49d209f966ce1edae68","amp;dn":"Buda+as+sharm+foru+rikht%282009%29Chs+subbed%2Cby+Suninmind%2C640+x+360","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c17c1ae09f907d5219fe49d209f966ce1edae68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,23,193,174,9,249,7,213,33,159,228,157,32,159,150,108,225,237,174,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
