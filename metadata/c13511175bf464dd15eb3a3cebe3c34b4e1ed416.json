You can enjoy the little nightingale anyway.\nJoselito plays an orphan a shrew treats badly.But he takes a job in a gypsies  small circus as a singer of course .Thus he will be able to travel across Spain and to find his mother.The only thing he 's got from her is a medal.Television will be a great help in his search.\nLike in &quot;Saeta del Ruisenor&quot;, there's a good fairy here too:an aristocrat ,a marquis ! \nA box of Kleenex is needed for the last third of the film.\n\nAvi, 84 min,1,41 gb \n\nEnjoy!\n\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;44373321362d2f75042225373029252d286a2229&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c13511175bf464dd15eb3a3cebe3c34b4e1ed416","amp;dn":"Ecoutes+ma+chanson%2C+Joselito+1959","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c13511175bf464dd15eb3a3cebe3c34b4e1ed416","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,53,17,23,91,244,100,221,21,235,58,60,235,227,195,75,78,30,212,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
