If it's one thing Mr. Fisher knows about, it's serial killers and serial killer culture. As the author of the infamous Jeffrey Dahmer comics Mr. Fisher was a hounded horror author who's work has been banned, burned and black listed around the world. The Garbage Man is a brutal, tortured film that took 16 years to be completed after Mr. Fisher's first love and live in girlfriend was murdered during filming.\n\nAfter nearly a decade of fighting to keep his girlfriend's murderer in prison, Mr. Fisher turned his artistic eye to finishing his lost masterpiece. The Garbage Man is a searing journey though a savage mind by day he's got bills to pay, a job he doesn't like and time to kill. But the voices in his head, voices burning him, hounding him, hurting him, screaming and taunting him with what they did to him as a boy....never stopping until he breaks, until he does what they want....until he does cruel bloody things...bad things.
