Berg [hour 4], a former deputy attorney general of Pennsylvania who brought a RICO lawsuit charging president George W. Bush and 154 others with complicity in the 9/11 attacks, and another suit challenging the eligibility of Barack Obama to become President of the United States. Berg contends that Obama was born actually in Mombasa, Kenya and that the &quot;Certification of Live Birth&quot; on Obama's website is a forgery. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.obamacrimes.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.obamacrimes.com/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.freerepublic.com/focus/news/2066207/posts&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.freerepublic.com/focus/news/2066207/posts&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nAlex also talks with Mike Adams [hour 2], the Health Ranger, and the founder of NaturalNews.com, an online news source covering all areas of personal and planetary wellness from nutrition to renewable energy. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.healthranger.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.healthranger.org/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.naturalnews.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.naturalnews.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nAlex also continues his discussion on the passage of Obamacare, covers other important news stories, and takes a number of calls. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.prisonplanet.com/the-cost-of-defying-obamacare-2250-a-month-and-irs-goons-pointing-guns-at-your-family.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.prisonplanet.com/the-cost-of-defying-obamacare-2250-a-month-and-irs-goons-pointing-guns-at-your-family.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.fireandreamitchell.com/2010/03/22/20-ways-obamacare-will-take-away-our-freedoms/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.fireandreamitchell.com/2010/03/22/20-ways-obamacare-will-take-away-our-freedoms/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance.
