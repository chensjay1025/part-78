Eastern Line 04:52\n\nFrom the foot-tapping opening track, Money, which nails the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Bohemian colours firmly to the mast, every following song on the album draws the listener ever deeper into the quirky and exotic world of HedonsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ songwriters, Bradley Tindall and Pete Coulam, each song a vignette inspired by the hidden corners of life and other imaginary places.\n\nItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s an album with deep retro roots but which still strives to create a unique sound: African hand drums and Indian tablas are accompanied by flourishes of Spanish-tinged trumpet; the yearning of a gypsy violin answered by the cry of blues slide guitar; the soft swirls of a chapel organ ambushed by power guitar chords and a driving rhythm section.\n\nAnd at the very heart of each song is Bradley Tindall, storyteller extraordinaire, his voice a personal invitation to an intimate universe, his voice a powerhouse of passion: sometimes dark, sometimes bright, sometimes subtle, sometimes raw.\n\nTales of the shadows, tales of the light.\n\nThese are great songs played well by musicians who clearly love what they do, and nothing alters the fact that itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a real keeper of an album thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s guaranteed to grow on you with repeated listening. If the HedonsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ plan is to conquer the world musically, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a plan thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s slowly and surely working, one album at a time.\n\nSeaside Caravan has it all: the tragedy of blues, the lilt of reggae, the swagger of rock, and more besides. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a glorious and unique soundscape that is ultimately one hell of a gypsy celebration of rock and roll.
