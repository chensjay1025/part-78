Each episode revolves around the fictional Scrooby Trevithick attempting to better himself\n\n\nScrooby is a well-meaning but flawed young man who is desperately trying to better himself through his own website, where he's left his web diaries.\n\nScrooby Trevithick went missing on the 1st of January 2008. He left behind no notes - just his beloved MP3 player - the MP3 player that he used to record everything that happened to him and his best mate Walshie. It is these recordings we hear in Series 1.\n\nThe 2nd series continues to follow the exploits of the hapless (but no longer lost) Scrooby. Each episode features him trying another pastime or possible new venture. This time, he is helped by his good friend, Sasha. Sadly, each new venture doesn't go the way Scrooby had planned and, in so doing, he gets increasingly frustrated at his lack of success.\n\nIn Series 2, Scrooby tries his hand at becoming a writer; a paparazzo; a councillor; a journalist; a performer; and an entrepreneur.\n\n\nCast:\nAndy Parsons\nBen Hurley\nFrankie Boyle\nKatherine Jakeways\nMarcus Brigstocke\nLucy Porter\nDara O'Briain\nHenry Naylor\nMicky Flanagan\nMichael Legge\nKerry Godliman\n\n\n\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/radio/scrooby_trevithick/episodes/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/radio/scrooby_trevithick/episodes/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nScrooby Trevithick - S01 - E01 - Motions \nScrooby Trevithick - S01 - E02 - Athletics \nScrooby Trevithick - S01 - E03 - Herb \nScrooby Trevithick - S01 - E04 - Agate \nScrooby Trevithick - S01 - E05 - Fridge \nScrooby Trevithick - S01 - E06 - Dream \n\nScrooby Trevithick - S02 - E01 - Entrepreneur \nScrooby Trevithick - S02 - E02 - Writer \nScrooby Trevithick - S02 - E03 - Paparazzo \nScrooby Trevithick - S02 - E04 - Councillor \nScrooby Trevithick - S02 - E05 - Journalist \nScrooby Trevithick - S02 - E06 - Performer \n\n\nAudio Format : MP3\nDuration : 28mn 1s\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nResolution : 16 bits\n\n\n\n\n[b]\nA number of people are posting my torrents on other trackers.\nI have no problem with that - (Not much need as I already do this) - But a name check would be nice\nI was the one who spent weeks,months,years recording them.\n\nThere is little point in downloading a &quot;Torrent&quot; and then recreating a &quot;Torrent&quot; using the same files.\n\nThe fact there was a torrent for you to download is clear you don't need to use the files to make another exactly the same version,\n\nAll you will do is split seeders over 2 torrents with the &quot;same&quot; files and make both have less seeders.\n\n\n\n[/b]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:808c1b5dc3e2292cb3ddca75bb40fcf902511e12","amp;dn":"Scrooby+Trevithick+-+S01+%26+02+-+Audio+Comedy+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"808c1b5dc3e2292cb3ddca75bb40fcf902511e12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,140,27,93,195,226,41,44,179,221,202,117,187,64,252,249,2,81,30,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
