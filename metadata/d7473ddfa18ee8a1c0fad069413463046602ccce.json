It follows a team of doctors and support staff stationed at the 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital in Uijeongbu, South Korea, during the Korean War.\nThe series premiered on September 17, 1972, and ended February 28, 1983, with the finale becoming the most-watched television episode in U.S. television history with 105.97 million viewers. \n\nMany of the stories in the early seasons are based on real-life tales told by real MASH surgeons who were interviewed by the production team. Like the movie, the series was as much an allegory about the Vietnam War (still in progress when the show began) as it was about the Korean War.[3] It took a number of minor creative liberties with the actual facts of the Korean War.\n\n\nM*A*S*H - S01E02 To Market!! To Market!! \nAfter black marketers hijack the 4077th and steal their supply of hydrocortisone, Hawkeye and Trapper concoct a deal with a local black marketer, Charlie Lee, to get some more. The catch: Henry has an antique oak desk, which they must trade in order to get some of it. Margaret and Frank become suspicious about their plotting, and about the Koreans who come to check out the desk, which is whisked away by chopper as Henry and Frank watch in disbelief. \n\n\nWayne Rogers  - Captain John Francis Xavier &quot;Trapper&quot; McIntyre \nAlan Alda Captain - Benjamin Franklin &quot;Hawkeye&quot; Pierce \nLarry Linville - Major Franklin Delano Marion Burns \nLoretta Swit - Major Margaret J. &quot;Hot Lips&quot; Houlihan \nMcLean Stevenson - Lt.
