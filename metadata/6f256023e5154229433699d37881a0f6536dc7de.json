It won the Experimental Film prize at the film festival in Venice[1] and much critical praise.\n\nIt is approximately 17 minutes in length, and comprises 190 shots of crowds of leisure-seeking people taken over 25 weekends in London's Piccadilly Circus. There is no narration, and no dialogue; a soundtrack consisting of several folk songs (including the American song &quot;Greenback Dollar&quot; and other skiffle songs) ties shots together into groups, while there is little recorded sound from the scenes shown on screen.\n\nThe filmmakers, both in their early twenties, made the documentary on a shoestring budget after receiving a grant of Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£240 from the British Film Institute. Chief among the film's subjects are movies and other entertainment; flirting, sex, and prostitution; and salesmanship and commodity culture\n\n\niNFOS\n\nFormat                           : AVI\nFile size                        : 181 MiB\nDuration                         : 17mn 38s\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 433 Kbps\n\n\nVideo\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nBit rate                         : 1 295 Kbps\nWidth                            : 576 pixels\nHeight                           : 416 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 1.385\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\nResolution                       : 24 bits\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.216\n\n\nAudio\n\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio Layer 3 MP3\nFormat_Settings_Mode             : Joint stereo / MS Stereo\nCodec ID                         : 55\nDuration                         : 17mn 38s\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nResolution                       : 16 bits\nStream size                      : 16.2 MiB (9%)\nInterleave, duration             : 40 ms (1.00 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration     : 504 ms\nWriting library                  : LAME3.97b","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f256023e5154229433699d37881a0f6536dc7de","amp;dn":"Nice+Time+%28dir.+Alain+TannerClaude+Goretta%2C+UK%2C+1957%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f256023e5154229433699d37881a0f6536dc7de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,37,96,35,229,21,66,41,67,54,153,211,120,129,160,246,83,109,199,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
