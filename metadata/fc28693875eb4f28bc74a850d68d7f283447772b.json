Angry protests have provided the Obama administration an opportunity to construct a nationwide tragedy out of the issue, and has afforded yet another grandstanding event to assault the Bill of Rights. While most Americans continue to be distracted by the divide-and-conquer and race-baiting tactics executed with expert skill, the White House is grateful attention has been diverted from their arming and training of Syrian Al-Qaeda affiliated rebels. \n\nThe White House also maintains pressure on NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden for revealing surveillance secrets that were already widely in circulation at the time of the scandal. \n\nOn today's show, Alex welcomes former New Jersey police detective and lead investigator for Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio's Cold Case Posse, Mike Zullo, to discuss new developments regarding Obama's birth certificate.\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential \n to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a\n spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the &quot;big \n picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media \n for news and info is a prescription for ignorance.
