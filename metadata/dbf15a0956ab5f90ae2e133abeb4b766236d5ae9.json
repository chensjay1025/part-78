More Randi reading recommendations belowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\nNEW: After 50 years of covering the White House, Helen Thomas resigned today at the age 89 amid a wave of controversy regarding a statements she made (video) regarding the Israel/Palestine conflict.\n\nUp to 460,000 gallons of oil a day are being captured by ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCut &amp; CapÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, but the feds estimate anywhere that amount only accounts for 37-77% of the crude still gushing into the Gulf. And settle in for a long, painful rideÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Adm. Thad Allen, the commander in charge of the federal response, acknowledges that even a best case scenario (a successful relief well being completed in August) still means dealing with this catastrophe well into the fall, if not longer.\n\nThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s little appetite out there for BPÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s $50 million PR campaign, and they arenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t just plastering the airwaves and newspapers with ads, theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re buying search terms from the major search engines in hopes of driving info-seekers to their own website. Over half of the federal judges where spill-related lawsuits are pending have financial connections to Big Oil. And if history is any guide, donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t expect to see BPÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s CEO being frog-marched regardless of what criminal charges stick.\n\nThe life that BP CEO Tony Hayward wants back: a multi-million dollar salary, no work on weekends, and he never misses a holiday.  Plus, how a gay escort service helped him get there.\n\nFrank Rich: DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Get Mad, Mr. President. Get Even.\n\nMore heartbreaking news on the economyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ 46% of those unemployed have been out of work for 6 months or longer, making it harder and harder to land a job. A gross new phenomenon: want ads stating that the unemployed need not apply. And according to Robert Reich, if weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re going to avoid a double dip recession, we need more government stimulus, tax cuts for the middle class, and tax hikes for the rich.\n\nMeanwhile, George Bush admits to waterboarding and says heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d do it againÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ geez - while former presidents often chose to become champions of human rights, GWB is actually touting human rights abuses. And a new report by Physicians for Human Rights details how Bush-era detainees were not only tortured, but also used as human guinea pigs in an effort to prove that they werenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t being tortured ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ WTF?! (more)\n\nAlso, you may wonder what the hell Elton John was doing singing at Rush LimbaughÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s wedding over the weekend. Turns out that Elton was given one million rea$ons to do so, but weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re still scratching our heads. Distracted, impatient and forgetful ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ your brain on technology (take a focus test). And Sandra Bullock locks lips with Scarlett Johansson at the MTV Movie Awards (video).\n\nAnd in addition to Bill PressÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ new book Toxic Talk, here are a few other new and old selections Randi recommends for your summer reading/re-reading list:\n\nBlinded by the Right: The Conscience of an Ex-Conservative by David Brock\n\nThe Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine by Michael Lewis\n\nThe Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism by Naomi Klein\n\nA People's History of the United States: 1492 to Present by Howard Zinn\n\nThese stories, your calls and much more on todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Randi Rhodes Show!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbf15a0956ab5f90ae2e133abeb4b766236d5ae9","amp;dn":"Randi+Rhodes+Show+-+June+07+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbf15a0956ab5f90ae2e133abeb4b766236d5ae9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,241,90,9,86,171,95,144,174,46,19,58,190,180,183,102,35,109,90,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
