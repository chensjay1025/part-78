Lyrics :\n\nI- Until AeonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Dawn (1:27)\n\n-Instrumental-\n\n \n\nII- Enchanting Melodies of Eternal Night (6:53)\n\n \n\nBeyond desertic fields of ice\n\nMonstrous winds claim for their homeland\n\nDefied, everything that stands still\n\nIs hit by the cold in their hearts\n\nSung is this desolating\n\nVictory, by the dead trees and the\n\nTroubling choirs of tortured wind\n\nEnchanting melodies of the Dark\n\n \n\nBeyond the magnanimity\n\nOf white snowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s claimed purple gardens\n\nOne grand crystal palace was built\n\nSymbol of the ruling of death\n\nHidden in a crystalline room\n\nStands the only living flower\n\nTrapped in a magic box of the\n\nOnly ice beholder of a spark\n\n \n\nLost once more, I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t know where to go\n\nLost the sacred memory\n\nI forgot, where am I from?\n\nOne broken branch from the grapevine\n\n-chorus-\n\nLost my only heartÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s bed\n\nNo where can he rest all peacefully laid\n\nAnother lost wanderer was born\n\nHow could I lose myself so easily?\n\n-chorus-\n\n \n\nBehold the magic\n\nFrom GaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯aÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s darkest childs\n\nRelentless lips\n\nKissing all your sins\n\n \n\nSeduced, I finally\n\nStood still against the wind\n\nMy heart was not cold\n\nMy heart was no more\n\n \n\nIn the realm of Forever-Night,\n\nMy one andÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ one and onlyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ my only heart is lost\n\n \n\n \n\nThe only thing for me to do is to\n\nFree the last flower from its wicked prison\n\nIt has the power to unveil the truth and the honor\n\nBut this Forever-Night will last until AeonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s dawn\n\n \n\n-chorus-\n\nBeyond snowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s invaded lands\n\nAn infant hides and stares at the sky\n\nCovered by the dying clouds\n\nOf greyness and of emptiness\n\nBeyond the Forever-Night\n\nAn infant deprived from her heart\n\nGets up and begins his last walk\n\nSheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s heading for the crystal palace\n\n \n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ where her last hope still lives\n\n \n\n \n\nIII- The Quest (5:02)\n\n \n\nJust a walk, the one, one last hope stands\n\nForgetting all the rules, refusing to conform\n\nIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m a prey in the grey\n\nOh why should I obey?\n\nYouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re lost, in the deep disarray\n\nOne last try to one day scream victoryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ VICTORY!\n\n \n\nOne more lost soul\n\nNow left with no colors\n\nA dead flower\n\nWho never saw summer\n\n \n\nWhere art thou hidden colors?\n\nThou mystic shades of life\n\nCan a dream still breathe\n\nafter dying so many times?\n\n \n\nNothing left to give\n\nAll yet to be born\n\nDying rules from Earth\n\nFor the rise of my dreams\n\n \n\nSeeking the Moonlight\n\nTeachings from the sea\n\nListen to thy heart\n\nAnd claim thy glory, and sing this song\n\n \n\n \n\nOne fantastic Quest for a new paradise\n\n \n\nOne day, no more I could give\n\nTo this world, like an empty bottle\n\nTearing my heart for this song\n\nIs just not a routine\n\n \n\n \n\nOne day, no more I could feel\n\nFor this world, when the last hope shall die\n\nThe final countdown has begun\n\nBut how long will it last?\n\n \n\nFor the love and for the passion beyond the skin\n\nFor the burning desire to unveil the mystery\n\n \n\nFrom all the pain left with only a stain\n\nCould only be cleaned by the truest loverÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s kiss\n\n \n\n- chorus-\n\n \n\nOne last dream to share\n\nOne more soul to harvest\n\nOne more try to\n\nOne day scream victory\n\n \n\nBreathing honesty\n\nBring me close to thee\n\nDying rules from Earth\n\nFor the rise of my dreams\n\n \n\n \n\nIV- Pleasures &amp; Satisfaction (3:54)\n\n \n\nI am not from a gutter\n\nEven though it feels like it\n\nI do not wish to murder\n\nSo why should I sing about it?\n\n \n\nDragons no more ride their wings\n\nAnd IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m not the one lie\n\nSatellite-illusions of stars shining\n\nMakes me want to cry\n\n \n\nWhatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the true meaning of Pleasures and Satisfaction?\n\nWhatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the true feeling of total liberation?\n\nIs a body deserted when it feels no more pain?\n\nIs the heart useless when it no more longs to cry?\n\n \n\nOh can the garden of purple gloom totally be conquered?\n\nOr will there forever be a flower somewhere living even if in ice?\n\n \n\n- chorus-\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nV- The Beginning (5:12)\n\n \n\nI still forever remember\n\nThe first time I heard\n\nDelightful sounds of hope\n\nAnd the burning rope\n\n \n\nI could not hide my tears\n\nFrom this divine beauty\n\nIt feels like I have\n\nNever lost myself\n\n \n\nWaves of passionate tenderness\n\nAngel of all angels lending me her shoulder\n\nMystical garden growing in the dark\n\n \n\n \n\nI still forever remember\n\nThe feeling I had,\n\nA rising universe,\n\nIts bewitching dream\n\n \n\nI discovered\n\nA lost fantasy\n\nWho opened its eyes\n\nAnd saw the Moonlight\n\n \n\n- chorus-\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nVI- Cruel Beauties (4:58)\n\n \n\nTake my hand\n\nI will never let you fall again\n\nLay your head on my breast\n\nI need you to feel my beating heart\n\n \n\nCloselyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ in youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\n \n\nSo many tears were shed\n\nLike rivers who cannot find rain\n\nSo many frozen dreams\n\nBroken by the tortured wind\n\n \n\nBut all this time it was there\n\nThe misty sounds of the deep sea\n\nAnd now by the snow its melody echoesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ oh oh\n\nMaking its way to my ears\n\n \n\nNever will a snow flake\n\nLay again in purple gardens\n\nNever will one living wonder\n\nBe all alone again\n\n \n\nBeyond this Forever-Night\n\nThe dead grey fades away\n\nBeyond the nightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s crisped sky\n\nThe Moonlight gently smiles\n\n \n\n- chorus-\n\nClosely into your frail body\n\n \n\nSo many mysteries\n\nLies in the seaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Cruel Beauties\n\nSo many living wonders\n\nSing their dreams to others\n\n \n\nNever will I doubt again\n\nThe return of the rain\n\nNever will I feel again\n\nThe fear of the Crystal pain\n\n \n\nBeyond her motherly hands\n\nIs where all the beauty stands\n\nBeyond her comforting breast\n\nMy heart found a place to rest\n\n \n\nVII- Lullaby (3:22)\n\n \n\nOh what a night\n\nDancing with the romantic breeze of spring\n\nFeels like I could fly with my wings\n\nMy new purple wings\n\n \n\nOh what a site\n\nDandelions play with me in the park\n\nFeels like my eyes now hold a spark\n\nA new mystic spark\n\n \n\nSing once again with me the melancholy\n\nAnd all the things we cannot see\n\nSing once again with me just a piece of truth and then weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll see\n\nJust how seldom is our wisdom\n\n \n\nOh what a smile\n\nA child has when his daddy comes back from work\n\nThe child doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t see heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s gone berserk\n\nThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s too much work\n\n \n\nOh what a scream\n\nA child makes when some monsters shakes its bed\n\nTheir teethÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s are brown, their eyes are red\n\nAnd I think it sounds fun\n\n \n\n- chorus-\n\n \n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe romantic breeze inspires rainbow twirling petals\n\nto dance with me where the Moonlight shinesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n \n\nOh what a spell\n\nChanges city parks into magic realms?\n\nLetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not say who is the lovely witch\n\nBehind all of this\n\n \n\n- chorus-\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nVIII- When Midnight Rings (3:04)\n\n \n\nAlright, tonight we will climb to the sky\n\nWe will ride the stars tonight\n\n \n\nI flee\n\nAnd you fly\n\nWe fly\n\nTonight\n\nIn the sky\n\n \n\nTonight\n\nWeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll ride the stars\n\nSo far\n\nWaiting\n\nMidnight to ring\n\n \n\nA lullaby for this wonderful night, climbing the stars\n\nA melody that makes the big monsters sleepy\n\n \n\nFlying\n\nIn new born spring\n\nWe sing\n\nThe hymn\n\nOf new born stars\n\n \n\n- chorus-\n\n \n\nA melody playing with the feeling\n\nOf when Midnight Rings\n\n \n\nA magic kingdom\n\nUnveils to my wide eyes\n\nRevealing to me\n\nHow to ride the stars\n\n \n\nJust hold on tight and\n\nDonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t close your eyes\n\nYou will soon see the Moonlight\n\nNightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s only ray of light\n\n \n\nIX- Tribal Rite (1:04)\n\n-Intrumental-\n\n \n\n \n\nX- Tribal Dreams (5:26)\n\n \n\nStepped into a beginning tale\n\nWhere it is Forever the Night\n\nMaybe I will live enough to tell\n\nA story from so far so close to the heart\n\n \n\nRainbow petals twirling in the night\n\nA garden growing in the dark\n\nResponding choirs from the stars\n\nMagical voices heard about everywhere\n\n \n\nHiding so softly, just for a moment\n\nSafely away, all alone to play\n\n \n\nStepped into an enchanting tale\n\nWhere the wind blows into its flute\n\nWhere trees play harp so magically\n\nInto the woods of Forgotten-Lands\n\n \n\nA small tribe stands around a fire\n\nAccompanying the melody\n\nAccompanied by an unknown voice\n\nWith strange instruments from another time and place\n\n \n\nHiding so softly, just for a moment\n\nSafely away, all alone to play\n\nFar away, around the fire\n\nTribal Dreams, humble fantasies\n\n \n\n \n\nXI- Hide Safely (6:01)\n\n \n\nSuddenly,\n\nThe Moonlight shines to me\n\nIt reaches me, into my humble bedroom\n\nSuddenly,\n\nI feel that I could flee\n\n \n\nMagically,\n\nIt seems that I can see\n\nAll the eyes, from forests that never dies\n\nSuddenly,\n\nThe tears fall into me\n\n \n\nThrough the trees, on the ground\n\nLies the light sought for so long\n\nThrough the branches and the caves\n\nSings a voice with unknown words\n\n \n\nSuddenly,\n\nSeems a voice into me\n\nSings to me, in unspoken tongues\n\nMagically,\n\nHer words I can now see\n\n \n\nTelling me,\n\nSoon you will see the sea\n\nFly the sky, and ride the stars\n\nTelling me,\n\nShe is Eternity\n\n \n\n-chorus-\n\n \n\nSuddenly,\n\nShe opened all my ears\n\nAnd I heard such wonders\n\n \n\nI have heard,\n\nEnchanting melodies\n\nFrom the roses and from the thunder\n\nThis is all,\n\nThat I can make of it\n\nThis is all that I can make of it\n\n \n\nXII- Nocturnal Eden (7:56)\n\n \n\nAn infant stares at the sky\n\nCovered by the Starlights\n\nAmazement fills his sparkly eyes\n\n \n\nAn infant learns to smile again\n\nCovered by the gentle Moonlight\n\nAll of his sorrows were not in vain\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ feeling so safely naked\n\n \n\nFinally the clouds are exploding\n\nDown down the rain is pouring\n\nHearing new colored birds sing\n\nAnd fantasies breathing\n\n \n\nLanded in a dream of deep enchantments\n\nOverwhelmed by new warmth into my chest\n\nFeelings of pleasure running into my body\n\nI open my eyes and forever let go\n\n \n\nAn infant bathes in the light\n\nCovered by MoonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s serenity\n\nFeeling that with his wings, to fly, he might\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ a universe whereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\n \n\nWilderness is full of wisdom\n\nAnd where the wisdom is wild\n\nWhere Angels are better seductress\n\nThen GaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯aÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s darker childs\n\n-chorus-\n\n \n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œnow that my garden richly grows\n\nwhy would I need to harvest autumnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s flowers?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n
