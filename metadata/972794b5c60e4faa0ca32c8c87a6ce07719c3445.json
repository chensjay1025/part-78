It covers an important event that occurs sometime between the end of Requiem for an Assassin and the start of The Detachment, the new Rain book that'll be out this summer. You can download it to your Amazon Kindle, your B&amp;N Nook, or via Smashwords directly to your computer as a PDF. There's also a program called Kindle for Mac, available from Amazon and Apple's App Store, that will allow you to download it from the Kindle store and read it on your Mac computer, iPad, or iPhone.\n\n\n\nFor most couples, a quiet dinner for two at Auberge de la Reine Blanche on the Ile Saint Louis would be just the thing to smooth out the complications in a romance. But for gorgeous Mossad operative Delilah and trying-to-retire contract killer John Rain, nothing is ever easy, and when Rain sees a crew of hard-looking men setting up outside the restaurant, he realizes someone has been bringing her work home with her. Is it a hitÃ¢â‚¬â€or something even worse? When it comes to killing, business and pleasure are the most dangerous mix of all.\n\nThis short story is about 8500 words, or a little under 40 pages in paper. The download comes with the first three chapters of the new John Rain novel, The Detachment (available soon), plus an essay called Personal Safety Tips from Assassin John Rain, which includes information that will be at least as valuable to civilians as it has been to Rain.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:972794b5c60e4faa0ca32c8c87a6ce07719c3445","amp;dn":"Paris+is+a+Bitch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"972794b5c60e4faa0ca32c8c87a6ce07719c3445","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,39,148,181,198,14,79,170,12,163,44,140,135,166,206,7,113,156,52,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
