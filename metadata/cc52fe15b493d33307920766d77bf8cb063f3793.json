Jones), as well as the multinationalist's New World Order agenda utilizing suppressed &quot;UFO&quot; technologies and their reasons for doing so.\n\n\nStan Deyo has held Above Top Secret Security Clearance and worked undercover for the FBI. He was part of an exclusive &quot;black project&quot;, headed by Dr. Edward Teller specializing in the development of &quot;flying saucer technology&quot;.\n\nStan's diverse background encompasses:\n\n    * computer programmer of main frames in 7 languages, PC and Macintosh\n    * senior systems analyst\n    * research physicist (both formally and self-educated)\n    * marine architect (self-educated)\n    * advanced propulsion engineer for marine, air and spacecraft\n    * author of two books and six scientific papers\n    * partner in Deyo Enterprises LLC - our R&amp;D, website hosting, book publishing and book distribution company for the last 30 years\n    * amateur archeologist in the Middle East ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ explored a real &quot;Indy Jones&quot; cave in the Qumran area of Israel\n    * TV documentary television host for several shows on Tesla (Eye of the Storm) and a series of three highly-rated shows on Channel 9 in Perth: UFOs Are Here, UFOs Deyo and You and UFOs Are Back\n    * university lecturer in 3D computer animation and graphic art\n    * Biblical student\n    * public lecturer on world events including:\n\n         1. The coming global economic collapse\n         2. Developing solar-related crises in the Earth's climate\n         3. The &quot;UFO&quot; deception and its real intent\n         4. Suppression of badly needed technologies\n         5. The coming destruction of America by civil war followed by foreign invasion\n         6. High voltage physics of &quot;cheaper&quot; energy\n\nBorn in Clifton, Texas to a family of American Pioneers, Stan spent his first two years in nearby Valley Mills with his grandparents until his father returned from the Middle East - a US Army Air Force Base Commander in WW2. Valley Mills is just seven miles from Crawford, home to President Bush's ranch.\n\nStan spent most of his youth in Dallas where he was a member of the National Honor Society, Captain of the rifle team, Lt. Colonel in the NDCC (ROTC), recipient of the Sons of the American Revolution Medal, and honored as one of the two most outstanding math students.\n\nGraduating high school just three months after his 16th birthday, Stan was awarded a partial engineering scholarship to the University of Texas and also was given a full congressional appointment (scholarship) to the US Air Force Academy at Colorado Springs.\n\nUpon returning to Dallas from USAFA, Stan trained in computer programming at IBM. Shortly thereafter, he formed his own &quot;mission impossible&quot; team solving extremely sensitive, difficult corporate computing problems.\n\nStan's main love is still advanced propulsion and &quot;free&quot; energy research which took him to Australia in '71 to work on these systems as part of a global project under the direction of such men as Dr. Edward Teller and Dr Andrei Sakharov.\n\nCurrently Stan is working on a Tesla-based energy system and several propulsion projects, is giving radio interviews, is an active partner in Deyo Enterprises LLC and is the CEO of HALO Orbital Technologies LLC.\n\nIn 1969, Stan experienced an NDE which only strengthened his Faith, though at the time, he was not a Believer. We have met with Hopi Indian elders in Arizona twice by invitation to discuss prophecy. We have visited the restricted access FNMOC at the US Navy base in Monterey to share Stan's method of earthquake prediction. (It's based on sea surface temperature fluctuations - something Stan formulated from the Navy's own data but they had not seen this use for it.) At Air Force Space Command in Colorado Springs (now headquartered in Omaha), we met with Major Green, affectionately known as &quot;Major Meteor&quot; by his colleagues, to discuss the probability of meteors impacting Earth. Stan has packed more into 62 years than most folks do in two lifetimes!\n\nStan's scientific approach is backed by extensive research. He is not motivated to make a &quot;quick buck&quot;, nor is he trying to sell anything other than his books that are treasured by those who have them. He feels obliged to let the public know both what he sees from a scientific perspective as well as from Biblical research.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc52fe15b493d33307920766d77bf8cb063f3793","amp;dn":"Stan+Deyo+-+The+Technology+of+the+New+World+Order+%282005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc52fe15b493d33307920766d77bf8cb063f3793","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,82,254,21,180,147,211,51,7,146,7,102,215,123,248,203,6,63,55,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
