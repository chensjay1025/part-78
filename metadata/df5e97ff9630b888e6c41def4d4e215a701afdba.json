Alex responds to the premeditated, staggering attacks against his character. Facing the reality of a declining viewership, the mainstream, mockingbird media is resorting to outright lies and slander as the public begins to turn away and think for themselves. \n\nThe Department of Homeland Security is trying to build a domestic army by giving local authorities armored tanks and heavy firepower in order to &quot;deal with the threat&quot; posed by the non-violent American public. Cities are already placing surveillance cameras and microphones above street corners across America. \n\nWell-known author and lecturer Red Beckman joins to show to showcase the tyranny of the IRS.\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential \n to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a\n spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the &quot;big \n picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media \n for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to\n share information that counters the monotone of mainstream\n corporate media. \n\n NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as\n information.
