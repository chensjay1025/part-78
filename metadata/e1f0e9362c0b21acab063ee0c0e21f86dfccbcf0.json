Though book and movie are very similar, \nthey contain also some differences. The book contains much more humor and is more optimistic too. The main problem \non the film is that the highlights of the book, which are due to the verbal acrobacy of Hotakainen, are impossible to \ntranslate to a movie. And the makers of the film have not managed to invent many new points which would render the \nloss of Hotakainen's best verbal insights. Though the film has its weaknesses, it is very fluently directed and \npleasant to watch. No matter have you read the book or not.\n\nInfo: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0372359/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0372359/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1f0e9362c0b21acab063ee0c0e21f86dfccbcf0","amp;dn":"Trench+Road+%28Juoksuhaudantie%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1f0e9362c0b21acab063ee0c0e21f86dfccbcf0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,240,233,54,44,11,33,172,171,6,62,224,192,226,31,134,223,204,188,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
