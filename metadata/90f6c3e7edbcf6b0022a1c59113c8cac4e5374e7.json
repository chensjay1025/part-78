Page's trademark axe work and loud-soft-loud dynamics are all over this CD. \n\nBut even though all the old Zeppelin elements are there, the duo aren't just reliving old glories. Bassist Charlie Jones and drummer Michael Lee as well as alternative rock uber-producer Steve Albini help keep these old gents current. \n\nAnd where Plant may not be able to wail like a castrated muezzin anymore, his singular voice still sounds as fresh as ever on the rockin' &quot;Sons Of Freedom,&quot; the bluesy &quot;Walking Into Clarksdale&quot; and atmospheric &quot;Heart In Your Hand.&quot;\n\n\n\nReleased by Atlantic Records on 21 April 1998. The follow-up album to No Quarter: Jimmy Page and Robert Plant Unledded, Walking into Clarksdale  took 35 days to record. The album was recorded and mixed by Steve Albini. The single &quot;Most High&quot; was awarded a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance in 1999.\n\nClarksdale is a town in the Mississippi Delta, historical home of Delta blues music.\n\nPlant re-recorded the song &quot;Please Read the Letter&quot; with Alison Krauss for their 2007 collaboration album Raising Sand.\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n(All songs by Page/Plant/Jones/Lee)\n\n\n   1. &quot;Shining in the Light&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:01\n   2. &quot;When the World Was Young&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:13\n   3. &quot;Upon a Golden Horse&quot; - 3:52\n   4. &quot;Blue Train&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:45\n   5. &quot;Please Read the Letter&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:21\n   6. &quot;Most High&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:36\n   7. &quot;Heart in Your Hand&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:50\n   8. &quot;Walking into Clarksdale&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:18\n   9. &quot;Burning Up&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:21\n  10. &quot;When I Was a Child&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:45\n  11. &quot;House of Love&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:35\n  12. &quot;Sons of Freedom&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:08\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90f6c3e7edbcf6b0022a1c59113c8cac4e5374e7","amp;dn":"Jimmy+Page+%26+Robert+Plant+-+Walking+into+Clarksdale+%281998%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90f6c3e7edbcf6b0022a1c59113c8cac4e5374e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,246,195,231,237,188,246,176,2,42,28,89,17,60,140,172,78,83,116,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
