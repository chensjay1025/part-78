They're not impossible to find or anything, but they're some of the more popular songs (in my circle anyway) so it's easier than trying to download some discography-esqu song list.\n\nTorrent contains:\n\n1. Break Down!\n2. Burning Heat!\n3. Cartoon Heroes\n4. Kakumei\n5. Oh Oh Oh, Sexy Vampire (Not a DDR song, but it fits)\n6. Paranoia\n7. Speed Over Beethoven\n8. Tsugaru\n9. Tsugaru (Apple Mix)\n10. The Whistle Song\n11. Butterfly\n12. Candy\n13. Beethoven's 5th\n14. End of the Century\n15. Dream a Dream\n16.
