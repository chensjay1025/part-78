This made Swedish news and got Johnny banned for a  few years. Some highlights are when Johnny asks the audience what side they were   in the war. And asking if there are any N!g-gers to move his amp. There is one part where you see Jerry Nolan get Johnny's attention just to shake his head as if to say &quot;this is NOT going well&quot;, iIt's like watching a car wreck.  \nThe show was never aired at TV show &quot;MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ndagsbÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rsen&quot;, only a short clip was used in the debate show &quot;Studio S&quot; about the influence on young people from rock music and drugs.\n(NOTE: audio is mono from one speaker only).         \n\n\n2) KÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ren, GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶teborg, SWEDEN 11/10/84        \nJohnny returns to Sweden a few years later and saves face. Does a great set and an acoustic encore. He even brings up his antics from a few years back. JOHNNY AT HIS BEST! \n\n\nPlease seed as long as you can. Enjoy!\ntroll64 \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:837aadb7d67631deadd49b7dbd61d1622a149dd8","amp;dn":"JOHNNY+THUNDERS+MONDO+ALMIGHTY+SERIES+VOLUME+2+DEATH+WARMED+OVER","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"837aadb7d67631deadd49b7dbd61d1622a149dd8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,122,173,183,214,118,49,222,173,212,155,125,189,97,209,98,42,20,157,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
