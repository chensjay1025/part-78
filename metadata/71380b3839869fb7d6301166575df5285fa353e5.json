Candy and Cindy's parents have traveled out of town for the weekend leaving the two sisters home alone. Cindy receives a mysterious package in the mail with a free DVD cartoon sent to her by the Devil himself. Candy is having a house party with some firends while Cindy views the cartoon in her room. She unintentionally lets loose two homicidal cartoon characters, Dr. Carnage and Max Assasin. They are out of the cartoon dimension and into the world as we know it. The feindish characters talk, torment and kill the partygoers in wild and kooky cartoon traditions. Cindy is the only one who has the power to stop the demented animations from continuing their insane murder spree. Can she save her friends? Can she save herself from the crazy mayhem?....or will everyone die?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71380b3839869fb7d6301166575df5285fa353e5","amp;dn":"Terror+Toons","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71380b3839869fb7d6301166575df5285fa353e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,56,11,56,57,134,159,183,214,48,17,102,87,93,245,40,95,163,83,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
