He hopes to safely lose up to half of his 417 pounds so he can be a superhero to his three kids and a knight in shining armor to his deserving wife. Mike was once a tremendous athlete in college, maintaining a vigorous nutrition and weight lifting regimen. But his body forgot what healthy living was like following his fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s untimely death, and Mike shifted his focus from fitness to family. Mike's intense desire to now reverse his unhealthy slide was unlike anything trainer Chris Powell has encountered. But when Mike becomes the first participant to ever fail the routine medical exam at boot camp, how will Chris move forward with Mike's weight loss journey? For one of his milestones, Chris wants to give Mike a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and box five-time World Heavyweight Champion Evander Holyfield.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7f752b7019ac479f095130c7db0f30090c4e9bd","amp;dn":"Extreme.Weight.Loss.S03E10.Mike.HDTV.x264-NY2.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7f752b7019ac479f095130c7db0f30090c4e9bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,247,82,183,1,154,196,121,240,149,19,12,125,176,243,0,144,196,233,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
