The film opens with an introduction of the nine cast members while they're being chased by bulls in a neighborhood. One by one, the cast members are taken down by the stampede, until only Johnny Knoxville and Bam Margera are left, and are chased through a house. Bam jumps through a window, and Johnny stops in his tracks to deliver his signature line, &quot;Hi, I'm Johnny Knoxville, welcome to Jackass!&quot;, and is pushed through a window by several bulls, and the title comes to screen, &quot;Jackass Number Two&quot;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81788e68026a72741ca104134da70d02cc0b5b11","amp;dn":"Jackass+Number+2+%28DVDrip%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81788e68026a72741ca104134da70d02cc0b5b11","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,120,142,104,2,106,114,116,28,161,4,19,77,167,13,2,204,11,91,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
