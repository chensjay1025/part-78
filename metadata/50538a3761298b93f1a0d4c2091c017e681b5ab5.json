VHS rip\n\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nDinosaurus! is a 1960 science fiction film directed by Irvin Yeaworth and produced by Jack H. Harris.[1] The leading role was intended for Steve McQueen, who starred in The Blob two years earlier, also directed by Yeaworth Jr. But for reasons not clear, the offer was never made to McQueen.\n\nPlot\nThe movie is about American men building a harbour on a Caribbean Island when they accidentally uncover two dinosaurs that have been frozen in suspended animation for millions of years. They are a Brontosaurus and a Tyrannosaurus rex. That night, during a storm, the beasts are struck by lightning and come back to life. The islanders have no idea that the dinosaurs are alive because of the storm and are now roaming the island. Also awoken is a caveman (played by Gregg Martell) who befriends Julio, an island boy, and along with the Brontosaurus get into a series of wacky misadventures, which lead to the death of the Brontosaurus and the caveman. Meanwhile the islanders have found refuge from the Tyrant Lizard King by hiding in the old fortress, which is protected by a ring of burning fuel. To ensure the Tyrannosaurus does not get in, the hero Bart (played by Ward Ramsey) drives out to face the beast in a mechanical digger. The two duel on the edge of an island cliff and, after a tense fight, the Tyrannosaurus is knocked into water, ending the island terror.[2] The film ends with a picture of the apparently dead Tyrannosaurus on the sea bed, with 'THE END' followed by '?' superimposed. Even though the movie ended with a question mark there was, as of June 8, 2010, no sequel.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50538a3761298b93f1a0d4c2091c017e681b5ab5","amp;dn":"Dinosaurus%21.AVI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50538a3761298b93f1a0d4c2091c017e681b5ab5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,83,138,55,97,41,139,147,241,160,212,194,9,28,1,126,104,27,90,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
