Originally a single B-side, it peaked at #8 on the Billboard Hot 100 on September 29, 1958 and #18 on the UK Singles Chart. The handclapping is performed by Sharon Sheeley, and the deep vocals at the end of each verse are done by Cochran. The drummer on that recording date was Earl Palmer.\n\nThe song was used in the 1980 movie Caddyshack. In March 2005, Q magazine placed it at #77 in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks.\n\nThe song is ranked #73 in Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\n\nPart of its lyrics address the controversy surrounding the voting age, which at the time was 21. Such protests would lead to the 26th Amendment, lowering the age to 18.\n\nBlue Cheer recorded it for their 1968  album Vincebus Eruptum. Their version, which omits all of the response lyrics heard in Cochran's version in favor of instrumental responses by each member of the band, was featured as one of the first heavy metal recordings in the 2005 documentary Metal: A Headbanger's Journey.\n\nDuring the '80s MTV played a black &amp; white video for the song, taken from a TV program, in their Closet Classics segment. The song was also featured in the 1986 movie Troll and the 1991 movie Night on Earth and the 1996 movie I Shot Andy Warhol.\n\nVincebus Eruptum is the debut LP of the American psychedelic blues-rock band Blue Cheer, released in January 1968  by Philips Records. It is widely considered to be the best Blue Cheer album, although this distinction is often awarded to their second release, Outsideinside. The Italian-based Akarma Records CD re-issue includes a bonus track, &quot;All Night Long&quot;, which was laid down during neither the &quot;Vincebus Eruptum&quot; nor the &quot;Outsideinside&quot; sessions; it was most likely recorded between late 1968 - after the departure of guitarist Leigh Stephens - and 1971, having been written by former Mint Tattoo keyboardist Ralph Burns Kellogg.\n\nThe song, &quot;Doctor Please&quot; was about Dickie Peterson's relationship with drugs. As he put it, &quot;ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s really strange because when I wrote the song (in 1967), it was a glorification of drugs. I was going through a lot of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œShould I take this drug or should I not take this drug? Blah, blah, blah.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ There was a lot of soul searching at the time when I wrote that song, and I actually decided to take it. ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s what that song was about and thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s what I sang it about, sort of a drug anthem for me.&quot; Also, he claimed it was meant to portray, &quot;the dark side of drugs&quot;.\n\nThe band's cover of &quot;Summertime Blues&quot; was one of Peterson's favorite songs to play live. He claimed, &quot;After 30 years man, I've had [a] love/hate relationship with this song but in the last 10/15 years I've really gotten to appreciate this song. Now you'd think after all these years I could do this song without blinking. This is the one song and I walk up to the mike and I can't remember a single word. Not one single word. It takes Duck walking over to me and say `Well' and then I am off.&quot;\n\nIn respect to Dickie Peterson's death, Sundazed Records released a 180-gram vinyl re-release of the album in its original mono-mix, in January 2010, 42 years after the album's original release and not too long after Peterson's demise.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt; \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e54030460305c57298ee52ec0679b298e5dad0e","amp;dn":"Blue+Cheer+-+Summertime+Blues+%28Beat+Club%29+%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e54030460305c57298ee52ec0679b298e5dad0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,84,3,4,96,48,92,87,41,142,229,46,192,103,155,41,142,93,173,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
