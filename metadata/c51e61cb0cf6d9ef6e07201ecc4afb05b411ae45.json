It features the singles &quot;Live for Love&quot; and &quot;Addicted to You&quot;, both of which Callea performed at popular morning show Sunrise. Callea co-wrote fourteen of the fifteen songs over a year. The album runs a length of just over an hour, containing many more upbeat and rocky songs in comparison with his self-titled debut. A New Chapter features two exclusive tracks entitled &quot;Whatever It Takes&quot; (originally recorded by Edyta GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³rniak for the album Invisible) and &quot;Meant for Love&quot; when purchased digitally, which didn't make the album's final cut. &quot;Meant for Love&quot; instead appeared on the &quot;Addicted to You&quot; single, along with &quot;Try&quot; and another iTunes-exclusive track &quot;Far from Over&quot;. The album debuted at #9 on the ARIA Albums Chart. On the Australian Albums Chart, the album debuted at #4. A New Chapter has since been certified gold by ARIA.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n1. \t&quot;A New Chapter&quot;   \t4:24\n2. \t&quot;Perfect Mistake&quot;   \t4:04\n3. \t&quot;Addicted to You&quot;   \t3:32\n4. \t&quot;If Only&quot;   \t3:51\n5. \t&quot;Best I Can Be&quot;   \t3:47\n6. \t&quot;Live for Love&quot;   \t4:05\n7. \t&quot;Stranded&quot;   \t4:30\n8. \t&quot;Want You To See&quot;   \t2:54\n9. \t&quot;Here I Go Again&quot;   \t4:31\n10. \t&quot;There's Always Time&quot;   \t3:46\n11. \t&quot;Almost&quot;   \t4:44\n12. \t&quot;You Saved Me Tonight&quot;   \t4:16\n13. \t&quot;Runaway&quot;   \t3:40\n14. \t&quot;Heartbeat&quot;   \t4:06\n15. \t&quot;Now You're Gone&quot;   \t4:16\n16.     &quot;Whatever It Takes&quot;      4:05","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c51e61cb0cf6d9ef6e07201ecc4afb05b411ae45","amp;dn":"Anthony+Callea+-+A+New+Chapter+%5B2006%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c51e61cb0cf6d9ef6e07201ecc4afb05b411ae45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,30,97,203,12,246,217,239,110,7,32,30,204,74,251,5,180,17,174,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
