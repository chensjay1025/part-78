Barish is born in Istambul, Turkey and this is his excellent first instrumental album Sensitive Crush from 2009. He is being the lead guitarist in bands such as Jaded Heart, Evidence One and Faro.\n\nThis CD is an all instrumental album with 10 tracks full of melodic guitar music, acoustic guitar tunes, some bluesy vibes and heavier stuff. Sahara, Time Will Tell and Chasing Stars are my favorites.\n\n\nDambek\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.barishkepic.com/index2.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.barishkepic.com/index2.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n01 - Loco Train\n\n02 - Life Cycle\n\n03 - Easy Monday\n\n04 - The Dark Spell\n\n05 - Lucky Breeze\n\n06 - Chasing Stars\n\n07 - Sensitive Crush\n\n08 - Sahara\n\n09 - Time Will Tell\n\n10 - Precious Moments","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8cb6dee4b1ada5c1c4d3b474b021a554bfc98e9","amp;dn":"Barish+Kepic+-+Sensitive+Crush+2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8cb6dee4b1ada5c1c4d3b474b021a554bfc98e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,203,109,238,75,26,218,92,28,77,59,71,75,2,26,85,75,252,152,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
