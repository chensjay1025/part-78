Ching escapes the massacre but his brother and\n        grumpy old misery of a father are burnt to death in an almighty\n        inferno caused by the killer. Ching, now homeless, wanders the\n        streets looking for scraps to eat and trying his best to stay\n        clear of the mad assassin. When he helps a very peculiar old man\n        in a fight with some streets acrobats, the grateful old man takes\n        him home to stay with him and his wife. The two grumpy old Taoists\n        teach Ching the gentle but deadly art of Tai Chi to prepare him\n        for the maniac killer who is still patrolling the area with the\n        aid of a giant wheel. Eventually the killer catches up with Ching,\n        who uses the soft approach to tackle the most insane of foes...\n\n        Insane, innovative genius from the Yeun brothers plus a brilliant\n        debut performance from Donnie Yen. A classic martial arts movie\n        for fight fans everywhere.\n\n        RiPPERS NOTES:\n\n        A long time ago we brought you the dubbed version of this crazy Yuen\n        Clan movie. Today we give you the Cantonese subtitled version. For\n        some reason, the intro speech was not subtitled, but it is hardly\n        neccecary to understand the plot. And if you by any chance have not\n        seen this before, it is in the same vein as our favourite Yuen Clan\n        movies such as Taoism Drunkard, Shaolin Drunkard and Miracle Fighters.\n        Or in other words: Don't miss it for the world!\n\n        English dubtrack included as extras.\n\n        To get English dub on this movie, follow these easy steps\n        =========================================================\n\n        Team GREiD uses the excellent multi platform tool found at\n       &lt;a href=&quot; http://xdelta.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://xdelta.org&lt;/a&gt; for applying external dub tracks to our releases.\n\n        Windows users: Unpack the movie and extras into a temporary directory.\n        Run gid-druc.english.bat.
