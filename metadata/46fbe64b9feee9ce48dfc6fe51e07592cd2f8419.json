Cleo is married to a cardiologist, Dr. Vincent Carrillo. But her success comes with zealous detractors and nasty lawsuits, something which Marilou can relate to.\n\nMarilou is widowed by her aged and ultra-rich husband, and her daughter-in-law, Amanda dela Vega, has arranged that she gets nothing except a small condo unit and a business on the verge of bankruptcy. Now, Marilou has to learn to get by on her own, something which her cousin, Tere Villanueva (Iza Calzado), has been doing since she was young. Tere works as a nurse, and becomes particularly close to an old woman named Amelia Marcelino. Tere sees herself in the dying woman and fears that she too might end up alone since she has been traumatized by one great love, Leon. But as if fate is teasing her, Tere is assigned to watch over a patient who happens to be Leon's wife.\n\nTere's best friend, Ada Villanueva (Jennylyn Mercado) is also suffering from heartache and regret for not accepting the marriage proposal of Jonathan, the father of her child. And now Jonathan is engaged to someone else. As an Executive Producer at a television network, Ada is able to raise her son, but barely has time to personally take care of him.\n\nChildren are the least of worries of Dara dela Vega (Bianca King). This spoiled daughter of Amanda is being given the cold shoulder at the same TV network where Ada works. Her arrogance for having studied in the US irks even the host of the show where she is a Junior Production Assistant. Aside from Ada, the only person who treats her nicely is Bogey, the cameraman, who advises her to adjust to the ways of her co-workers.\n\nJonathan's friend in the Call Center, Tobz, is seeing an ambitious girl who claims that she is a model. Wendy Casuga (Cristine Reyes) idolizes beauty queens who become socialites, just like Marilou Cobarrubias. She frequents the so called go-sees for casting of television commercials and television shows, and is sometimes accepted as an &quot;extra.&quot; Unknown to Tobz, Wendy is not the least serious with him. She is after men who are rich, but insists that she will not get involved with married men, unlike her best friend Baby, who is having an affair with Melvin Cabigting.\n\nMelvin is married to Paula Cabigting (Eugene Domingo). Paula is hardworking, trying out every kind of business she can think of, while Melvin is doing nothing since he got back from the US, having been affected by the recession. Paula cannot even rely on Melvin to drive for her to deliver goods to her clients that she still has to hire a service vehicles owned by a bachelor, Nelson Obleta. Thus begins another complicated relationship.\n\nEach with their own troubles, these Working Girls just try to belong and be loved.\n\n\nGeneral\nComplete name                    : Working Girls by Sea Dragon.avi\nFormat                           : AVI\nFile size                        : 896 MiB\nDuration                         : 1h 49mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 141 Kbps\nVideo\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nWidth                            : 672 pixels\nHeight                           : 448 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 1.500\nFrame rate                       : 29.970 fps\n\nAudio\nCodec                            : MP3\nBit rate                         : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\n\nNOTE: hindi po to sa akin na rip, gusto ko lang e share sainyo\nlahat na credits goes to sea dragon. salamat\n\n\nGreeting:\nsribats75,Sea Dragon,Wingtip,Promoter,AkOsiPaLoS,markrhev,Black Dragon,Robert,\nsa lahat ng p2p Pinoy member,rippers,at uploader..ung iba hindi ko man kau nkakausap\npero kayo po ay kapuso ko at kapamilya na tayo'y iisa...\n\n\n\nplease seed po\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46fbe64b9feee9ce48dfc6fe51e07592cd2f8419","amp;dn":"Working+Girls+2010+by+Sea+Dragon+%28+Filipino+%7C+Tagalog+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46fbe64b9feee9ce48dfc6fe51e07592cd2f8419","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,251,230,75,159,238,233,206,72,223,198,254,81,224,117,146,205,47,132,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
