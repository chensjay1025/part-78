Jarrett's passion for Nora leads him peripherally into a sub-culture of animals where he encounters Vic, a renegade whose animal instincts are stronger than his human ones. As things begin to get even worse, Jarrett realizes that his best chance for happiness, and survival, lies in his true love for Jane. Written by Matthew Temple \n# In Reno, Vic and Nora form an unusual couple of predators between human and animals that feed of human blood and enjoy having sex. Nora decides to leave Vic and heads to Clayton Valley, where she meets the former football player Jarrett in the bar Jules' Joint. Jarrett was in college with a scholarship, but he had an accident that interrupted his promising career and he had returned to his hometown. His best friend Jules idolizes him and has many pictures and trophies of Jarrett exposed in his bar; the bartender Jane has a secret crush on him. Presently Jarrett has a problem with his chief Vaughn that persecutes him at work. Nora is harassed by Vaughn in the bar, but she refuses his invitation and goes to Jarrett's house; she bites him while they have wild sex. Jarrett feels his senses more accurate but he does not understand what is happening to him.
