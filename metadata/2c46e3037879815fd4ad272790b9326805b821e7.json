They see the location empty, but sooner they are attacked by zombies. Johnny escapes in his car leaving Barb alone, but she is rescued by the drug dealer and college student Ben. He drives his motorcycle to the Cooper farm, and the patriarch Henry Cooper does not give credit to Barb. When the farmhouse is under siege of a group of flesh-eaters zombies, the local mortician Gerald Tovar Jr. arrives and tells a scary story about the origin of the zombies. \n\nvideo:512x288 \nDivx","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c46e3037879815fd4ad272790b9326805b821e7","amp;dn":"Night+of+the+Living+Dead+3D+%282006%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c46e3037879815fd4ad272790b9326805b821e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,70,227,3,120,121,129,95,212,173,39,39,144,185,50,104,5,184,33,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
