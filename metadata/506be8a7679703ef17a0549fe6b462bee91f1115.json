Ã‹Ë†in-fÃ‰â„¢-nÃ‰â„¢t :\nsubject to no limitation or external determination \n\nTo send files, it's as simple as a drag and drop.\nFor incoming transfers, just choose to accept or decline. \n\nThere are no limits on file size in Infinit.\nYou can share anything, of any size, with anyone, anywhere. \n\nFile transfer speeds are faster than any other file sharing product because\nInfinit is built on a peer-to-peer technology. \n\nInfinit integrates with the Finder on Mac OS X,\nbringing sharing functionalities close to your files. \n\nWe've built Infinit so that your data stays completely secure.\nOnly the sender and recipient have access to the files being transferred. \n\nTurning off your device pauses your transfer. Your in-progress\ntransfers resume automatically as soon as youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re back online.
