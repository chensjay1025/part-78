If you use it correctly, \nand in combination with other programs such as data backup utilities, \nit will significantly reduce the risk of your computer being attacked or \ninfected by a virus, and thus the risk of losing important or private data.\nThe Avast! Internet Security application comes with an antispam filter and \nbuilt-in firewall. Once installed, avast! runs silently in the background to protect \nyour computer against all known forms of malware. You don't need to do anything else - \njust install and forget! Active internet users need greater protection for \nthemselves as they shop and bank on-line. To secure against threats from infected \nweb sites and the growing risk of identity theft, avast Internet security provides \nyou with continuous protection from its layers of antivirus, anti-spyware, \nanti-rootkit protection, firewall and antispam.\n\nReal-time shields. The real-time shields are the most important part of \nthe program, as they are working continuously to prevent your computer from \nbecoming infected. They monitor all your computer's activity, \nchecking all programs and files in real-time - i.e. at the moment a program \nis started or whenever a file is opened or closed.\n\nVirus Chest. The virus chest can be thought of as a folder on your hard disk \nwith special properties, that make it a safe, isolated place for storing \npotentially harmful files. You can work with the files in the virus chest, \nwith some security restrictions.\n\navast! antispam filter. avast! Internet Security includes a fully integrated \nantispam filter to detect unwanted email.\nSpam delivered to your mailbox can result in your mailbox quickly becoming full, \nas a result which, legitimate emails may not be received. It can also unnecessarily \nincrease the load on the email server, internet connection, local networks etc.\n\nFirewall. avast! Internet Security includes a fully integrated firewall which \ncan be controlled directly from the avast! user interface.\nThe firewall monitors all communication between your computer and the outside \nworld and blocks unauthorized communication based on a number of &quot;allow&quot; and &quot;deny&quot; rules. \nIn this way, the firewall can prevent sensitive data from leaving your computer and \ncan also block attempted intrusions by external hackers\n\nCommand-line scanner. The ashCmd program uses the same avast! scanning engine \nto detect potential malware infections so the results are exactly the same as \nrunning a scan via the normal program interface. The avast! command-line scanner, \nashCmd.exe, is normally installed in the directory C:Program FilesAlwil Softwareavast5.\nA scan is run from the command prompt using various switches and parameters. \nTo see a description of the parameters, locate the ashCmd file and double click on it. \nThis will open a new window in which the various parameters are displayed.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Continuous protection against viruses and spyware\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Ensures all mails sent and received are clean\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Keeps you protected from &quot;chat&quot; infections\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Stops attacks from hijacked websites\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Lets you safely browse suspicious websites or run unknown applications\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Blocks hacker attacks to protect your identity\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Keeps your mailbox free from spam\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Allows safe and uninterrupted gaming\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Compatible with Windows XP, Vista and 7\n\nKey technologies:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Improved Antivirus and anti-spyware engine\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ New avast!
