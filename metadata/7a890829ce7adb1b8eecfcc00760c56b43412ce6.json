Where Senseney contributes the country and folk influences of his childhood and from his stint in Americana outfit Art in Manila, Drootin (best known for playing with brooding indie rockers the Good Life) lays down rock-solid rhythms. The result is a sound that captures their country boy-meets-city girl story, landing somewhere between a honky tonk bar and a hip lounge. As White Hat moves from rambling hard-luck tales to foot-stomping bar ballads to delicate love songs, the songwriting recalls the moodiness of Nick Cave and humor of Townes Van Zandt, never getting too heavy or silly thanks to SenseneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s warm baritone and subtle, honey-dripped drawl. SenseneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s delivery is generally laid-back and cool, but there are surprises, too -- the swaggering guitar and syncopated percussion of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Out in the FieldÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ help to slowly propel his vocals to their most fiery. Meanwhile, storytelling shines on the saloon piano-driven opening track Ã¢â‚¬Å“Nadine,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ following a woman who takes off to California to leave behind her lover, only to meet a new man who is unfaithful, and has a postscript in closer Ã¢â‚¬Å“Oh Nadine,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ an appeal to come home written from the perspective of her father. Like a great pair of shoes (or in this case, maybe cowboy boots), White Hat is comfortable and un-fussy, a natural choice for a road trip or a night at the bar. It falls short in not taking enough advantage of Drootin's repertoire -- for example, only tracks like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Let Me Lend My ShoulderÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ hint at the angelic vocals she has to offer -- but all in all, it's a promising introduction that will leave listeners eager for more.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a890829ce7adb1b8eecfcc00760c56b43412ce6","amp;dn":"Big+Harp+-+White+Hat+%5B2011%5D%5BFLAC%2FWEB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a890829ce7adb1b8eecfcc00760c56b43412ce6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,137,8,41,206,122,219,27,142,236,252,192,7,96,197,107,67,65,44,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
