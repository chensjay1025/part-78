Collins's approach to the blues guitar is distinctive, and he alternates between high, singing leads and echoey, low-end motifs, manipulating space and drawing his phrases out with unusual rhythmic variation. His tone, too, is unique; it is heavy, dark, and somewhat cool (which gave rise to his &quot;Iceman&quot; moniker). All of these characteristics are on full display here.\n\n[\n1.
