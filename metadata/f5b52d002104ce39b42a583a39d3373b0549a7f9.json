Babbitt is a complicated and conflicted character. When you think you have his next move figured out he surprises you. As you begin to like him, he does something to evoke the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œwhat a ratÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ response.\n\nMale menopause wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t a pre Great Depression term, but I would say George has all the symptoms. At a pudgy balding forty six he looks at his life, wife, family and business. He sees himself as a pretty successful business man, but when Tanis, the lonely widow has a leaky roof, he sees an opportunity for perhaps a more fulfilling relationship then he has at home. Add to Tanis a foray into radical politics, and we are about to witness an emotional and financial train wreck with Babbitt at the throttle.\n\nThis is a long story, but well worth listening to. Human nature hasn't changed much in the last ninety years.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5b52d002104ce39b42a583a39d3373b0549a7f9","amp;dn":"Librivox+M4B+-+Babbitt+by+Sinclair+Lewis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5b52d002104ce39b42a583a39d3373b0549a7f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,181,45,0,33,4,206,57,180,42,88,58,57,211,55,59,5,73,167,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
