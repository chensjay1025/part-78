Tintin, Calculus, and Haddock soon are accused themselves and, travelling to San Theodoros to clear their names (though Tintin at first refuses, only to change his mind and follow a couple of days later), find themselves caught in a trap laid by their old enemy, Colonel Sponsz, who has been sent by the East Bloc nation of Borduria to assist Tapioca. Sponsz has concocted the conspiracy of which Tintin and his friends are accused in a plot to wreak revenge upon them for humiliating him in The Calculus Affair. Escaping, Tintin, Haddock, and Calculus join Alcazar and his small band of guerrillas, the Picaros, in the jungle near a village of the Arumbaya people.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/59/Tintin_cover_-_Tintin_and_the_Picaros.JPG&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/59/Tintin_cover_-_Tintin_and_the_Picaros.JPG&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nenjoi,\n\nsani\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3521974a0800d0843733d4c06d51ae6fc5a12b9","amp;dn":"The+Adventures+of+Tintin+%C3%A2%E2%82%AC%E2%80%9C+Tintin+and+the+Picaros","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3521974a0800d0843733d4c06d51ae6fc5a12b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,82,25,116,160,128,13,8,67,115,61,76,6,213,26,230,252,90,18,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
