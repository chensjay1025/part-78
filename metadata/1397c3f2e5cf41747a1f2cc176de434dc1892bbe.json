October 2007 and supported by all the big names like Armin van Buuren, TiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â«sto, Above &amp; Beyond, Sander van Doorn, Andy Moor, Menno de Jong and many more.

From early age Lars always loved electronic dance music. In the late 90s he discovered the trance genre and started collecting music and cdÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s. After some years he decided to buy turntables and started practising mixing. Soon after, he also started to produce his own tracks. After some years he teamed up with talented producer Tore Vatle Jensen and founded ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“The BlizzardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. \n\nTore Vatle Jensen: \n\nComposer and keyboard player Tore Vatle Jensen was born in Norway in 1979. His musical preferences are everything from jazz, 70ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s funk, hip hop, film scores and classical music to just about every electronic genre around. After being a bedroom producer for 12-13 years, with aliases such as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Tinnitus ProjectÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Koma SupraÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, he graduated as a sound engineer from NISS (Nordic Institute of Stage and Studio) in Oslo, Norway. Later that year (2006) he teamed up with Lars-Christian Nyheim and founded ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“The BlizzardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. \n\n\n************************************************************************ \n\nThe Blizzard and Omnia - Metanoia \n\n************************************************************************ \n\n\nWhat to do when your sound is very much alike someone else's? You join forces! \nThat's exactly what Omnia and The Blizzard did. Norwegian producers Lars-Christian Nyheim and Tore Vatle Jensen of The Blizzard teamed up with Ukrainian producer Smirnov Aleksandrovich, and made their sounds melt into one beautiful ensemble. 'Metanoia' is the first result of their fruitful studio time together. \n\nThe eerie, atmospheric sounds, as heard on the previous The Blizzard releases 'Iselilja' and 'Kalopsia', make a strong pact with the light and melodic works of Omnia. Balancing things out till the very last beat, 'Metanoia' represents trance and progressive in perfect harmony. More collabs of this trio are coming up, so keep an eye out! \n\nOn the remix, we've got German talent Dennis Sheperd, who impressed us with his tyDi collab 'Somehow' last year. This year he kicks off with a spine-tingling, but more cheeky remix of 'Metanoia'. Last but not least, the pack provides an epic touch-up of 'Metanoia' by young talent EDU, playful and energetic.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1397c3f2e5cf41747a1f2cc176de434dc1892bbe","amp;dn":"The+Blizzard+and+Omnia+-+Metanoia+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1397c3f2e5cf41747a1f2cc176de434dc1892bbe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,151,195,242,229,207,65,116,122,31,44,193,118,222,67,77,193,137,43,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
