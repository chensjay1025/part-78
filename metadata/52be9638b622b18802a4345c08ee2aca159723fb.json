Further the movie in John Milton's trenchant speech questions the very notion of righteousness in the post-modern world. Milton's speech rips apart the whole discourse of religion when he presents the inherent contradiction of it. Kevin's dilemma reflects the modern man who accuses the circumstances for being what he is,the culture dominated by making money 'which build egos of the size of cathedral', the question is can one really call what one does 'freely-willed'?. The movie deals with these 'Hamltian questions' in a lawyer's mind.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118971/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118971/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLanguages: English/German/Spanish.\n\nSubtitles: English/German/Spanish/Dutch/Swedish/Norwegian/Danish/Finnish/\n           Portuguese/Hebrew/Polish/Greek/Czech/Turkish/Hungarian/Icelandic/\n           Croatian/French/Italian.\n\nSpecial Features: Trailer/Tv Spots/Audio Commentary.\n\nPlease seed when downloading finish.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52be9638b622b18802a4345c08ee2aca159723fb","amp;dn":"Devil%5C%27s+Advocate+%281997%29+pal+dvd9+-+MULTISUBS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52be9638b622b18802a4345c08ee2aca159723fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,190,150,56,182,34,177,136,2,164,52,92,8,238,42,202,21,151,35,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
