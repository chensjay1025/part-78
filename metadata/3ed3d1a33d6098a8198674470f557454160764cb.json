This is not needed except for old old cards.  Just patching with Rudolphs patch is enough for most cards.  The G6 just hasn't been updated in eons.\n\n\nThis is the G6 card it was tested on &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.g6flash.com/main.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.g6flash.com/main.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\nwith a passme device.\n\n-pt\n\n\nupdate:\n\nkid now has 8 badges using this SS rom on G6 Lite with 0 freezes.  So I would say its workin.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ed3d1a33d6098a8198674470f557454160764cb","amp;dn":"Pokemon+HeartGold+SoulSilver+for+G6+lite.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ed3d1a33d6098a8198674470f557454160764cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,211,209,163,61,96,152,168,25,134,116,71,15,85,116,84,22,7,100,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
