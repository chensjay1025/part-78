Other contributors to the documentary highlight:\n\n    * How the U.N. Commission on Human Rights includes some of the world's worst human rights abusers\n    * How the U.N. Commission on Human Rights has targeted Israel with more violations than any other country\n    * The U.N.'s failure to initially account for the slaughter of 8,000 Bosnian Muslims in Srebrenica\n    * The need for top to bottom U.N. reform\n\n'Broken Promises' reports how the U.N. mishandled tribal conflicts in Rwanda resulting in the devastating loss of life and mass killing of nearly one million. Mother-to-be Eugenie Mukeshimana recounts for the first time her harrowing escape from the massacre and the inability of the U.N. to quell the rioting and mass killings.\n\n'It's not that the U.N. didn't know what was going on. It's just that they were told not to do anything,' said Ms. Mukeshimana.\n\nBroken Promises takes viewers on an exploration of many international crises from the hostility between India and Pakistan in 1947, to the Arab/Israeli conflicts of the late 1940's, to the slaughter of millions of Cambodian refugees by Pol Pot in the 1970s and the aforementioned hardships and genocides in Rwanda and Bosnia, to the present day oil for food scandal.\n\n'Broken Promises, The United Nations at 60' is a clarion call to action for the United Nations to live up to the goals and objectives its charter mandated sixty years ago. Will the international community be up to the challenge? \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.brokenpromisesmovie.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.brokenpromisesmovie.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n  ____                      _                      _   _       _\n / ___|___  _ __  ___ _ __ (_)_ __ __ _  ___ _   _| | | |_   _| |__\n| |   / _ \\| '_ \\/ __| '_ \\| | '__/ _` |/ __| | | | |_| | | | | '_ \\\n| |__| (_) | | | \\__ \\ |_) | | | | (_| | (__| |_| |  _  | |_| | |_) |\n \\____\\___/|_| |_|___/ .__/|_|_|  \\__,_|\\___|\\__, |_| |_|\\__,_|_.__/\n                     |_|                     |___/\n   ____\n  / ___|___  _ __ ___\n | |   / _ \\| '_ ` _ \\\n | |__| (_) | | | | | |\n(_)____\\___/|_| |_| |_|\n\n\nPLEASE KEEP SEEDED TO PASS ON THE MESSAGE.
