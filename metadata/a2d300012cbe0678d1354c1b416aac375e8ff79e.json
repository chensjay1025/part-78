Roland is the last gunslinger--replete with dusty Old West garb and a duo of six-shooters--and he is searching for the elusive man in black. A solitary traveler, Roland treks endlessly through desperate surroundings, passing derelict outposts, participating in violent showdowns. He finally arrives at a way station in the middle of the desert where he meets a young boy named Jake. Together they will battle unspeakable enemies before facing adecision. Stephen King is the undisputed master of horror and suspense. One of the best-selling and most widely read authors of all time, King writes with a universally appealing style that never fails to inspire fear and wonder in the hearts and minds of his readers.
