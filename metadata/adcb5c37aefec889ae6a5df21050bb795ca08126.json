NOT\nto be sold, only freely traded! This is my favorite 1994 show, I enjoy it\nnow more with 4 different sources, I hope you enjoy it too.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nMetallica\nMiddletown Madness\n1994.06.17\nMiddletown, NY, USA\nOrange County Fairgrounds\nFLAC\n4 Sources\n8 Discs\n\nSource 1: Pile Of Shit, Audience\nSource 2: Soundboard\nSource 3: Audience #2\nSource 4: MTX by FeX-\n\n-------------------------------\n\nSOURCE 1:\n\n2 Discs\nAudience\n\n&quot;Pile Of Shit&quot;\n\nCountry Of Origin : Italy\nCompany : KISS THE STONE\nCode: KTS365/366\n\nLineage Info: Commerical CD-R -&gt; EAC -&gt; WAV -&gt; FLAC Frontend\n\nCD1\n01 Breadfan\n02 Master Of Puppets\n03 Wherever I May Roam\n04 Harvester Of Sorrow\n05 Sanitarium\n06 The God That Failed\n07 Kill/Ride Medley\n08 For Whom The Bell Tolls\n09 Disposable Heroes\n10 Seek &amp; Destroy\n11 Nothing Else Matters\n\nCD2\n01 Creeping Death\n02 Fade To Black\n03 Whiplash\n04 Sad But True\n05 One\n06 Enter Sandman\n07 So What\n\nExtra Tracks on CD2 recorded at Chicago on 3 July 1994.\n08 London Dungeoun - Last Caress - Green Hell (w, Danzig)\n09 So What (w, Suicidal Tendencies)\n\nFixed: tracks had a gap between them, so I had to remove the silence from each track, checksums\nmay differ but everything else is the same, you can skip this source if you already have Pile Of Shit.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nSOURCE 2:\n\n2 Discs\nSoundboard\n\nLineage Info: SBD &gt; ??? &gt; CDR &gt; EAC &gt; WAV 44k/16bit &gt; FLAC Level8\n\n*Intro \n*The Ecstasy Of Gold\n*Breadfan\nMaster Of Puppets\nWherever I May Roam\nHarvester Of Sorrow\nWelcome Home (Sanitarium)\nThe God That Failed\nKill/Ride Medley\nFor Whom The Bell Tolls\n*Disposable Heroes\nSeek &amp; Destroy\nGuitar Solo\nNothing Else Matters\nCreeping Death\nFade To Black\nWhiplash\nSad But True\nOne\nEnter Sandman\nSo What\n\nThis source very rare to find in loseless! Its the same source\nthat can be download freely from the metallica vault in mp3.\nThis one actually has So What which was missing from the vault!\n\nI was very doubtful that this is a loseless source but\nafter looking at the Freq Analysis it turns out to be \nloseless and 2 people have confirmed this to be a true\nloseless source. A very rare source indeed. I'm pretty sure this\nis loseless, that or the Freq Analysis is acting fishy\n\nTracks marked with a * are taken from another source!! \nI think Disposable Heroes is SBD but im not sure so I added\na * to it, maybe someone can confirm this. \n\n-------------------------------\n\nSOURCE 3:\n\n2 Discs\nAudience\n\nLineage Info: AUD &gt; ??? &gt; CDR &gt; EAC &gt; WAV 44k/16bit &gt; FLAC Level8\n\nIntro \nThe Ecstasy Of Gold\nBreadfan\nMaster Of Puppets\nWherever I May Roam\nHarvester Of Sorrow\nWelcome Home (Sanitarium)\nThe God That Failed\nKill/Ride Medley\nFor Whom The Bell Tolls\nDisposable Heroes\nSeek &amp; Destroy\nGuitar Solo\nNothing Else Matters\nCreeping Death\nFade To Black\nWhiplash\nSad But True\nOne\nEnter Sandman\nSo What\n\nAnother Audience source of this show. You may think that\nthis is the 1st source, well its not! It sounds a lot like\nPile Of Shit but I took a very very close listen and observed it, \nthis is a brand new source. I checked atleast 6 times and confirmed thrice.\nThere are crowd noises that you hear on this source which cannot be heard\non the 1st source, therefore proving that it was a different taper\nstanding at a different location because people's accent and speech\nsound different on the other source at the same time. You can yourself\nzoom in audacity and compare the two sources, zoom in to the max and find\nsome spots and hear the audience noise when the band is not playing, you will\nobserve they are different sources. Most likely both tapers used the same\nequipment or someone has a done a kick ass mastering job. Eitehr way enjoy this\nbrand new source! If you still insist that this is the 1st source, I will show you\nevidence. Rock Am Ring 2006 LiveMet and Original Audio both sound very similar,\nhowever they are 2 different sources when you closely observe, same story with this\none, just think of it like RAR 2006.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nSOURCE 4:\n\n2 Discs\nMTX\n\nLineage Info: 3 Sources WAVs &gt; Audacity &gt; WAV 44k/16bit &gt; FLAC level8\n\nIntro \nThe Ecstasy Of Gold\nBreadfan\nMaster Of Puppets\nWherever I May Roam\nHarvester Of Sorrow\nKirk Solo #1\nWelcome Home (Sanitarium)\nDrum Solo\nThe God That Failed\nKill/Ride Medley\nIntro To Bells\nFor Whom The Bell Tolls\nKirk Solo #2\nDisposable Heroes\nSeek &amp; Destroy\nKirk Solo #3 - The Unforgiven Jam\nNothing Else Matters\nCreeping Death\nJason Solo - Orion Jam\nFade To Black\nWhiplash\nJam\nSad But True\nOne\nEnter Sandman\nSo What\nOutro\n\nMTX created by me (FeX-)\n\nThis was my second ever MTX created, Buffalo 94 being my first.\nI think this one turned out much better since I had 3 sources\nto work with and all 3 sounded great, including a clean SBD!\nThere are small parts where it kinda echoes but you wont notice\nit because its mostly during James' speech before a song for a few\nseconds, its not a big deal but its clear throughout the songs. Any\nartwork created will be much appreciated. I know for a fact that there\nis one more source out there of this show on FLAC, I hope someone releases it,\nI know it exists!\n\n-------------------------------\n\nRequests:\n\n- Any 1988-1994 Loseless sources not seeded here before\n- 5th Source of this show\n- DO NOT SELL\n- DO NOT CONVERT TO LOSSY FORMATS\n- Please create artwork for source 2, 3 and 4.\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:adcb5c37aefec889ae6a5df21050bb795ca08126","amp;dn":"Metallica+-+1994.06.17+-+Middletown+Madness","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"adcb5c37aefec889ae6a5df21050bb795ca08126","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,203,92,55,174,254,200,137,174,106,93,242,16,80,187,121,92,160,129,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
