It burns\n              five times hotter than the surface of the sun. And it\n              can strike you dead pretty much out of the blue.\n              Thirty million volts of electricity colliding with the\n              human body are enough to stop your heart, zap your\n              memory, and change your personality. Following the\n              stories of lightning victims - some recent victims,\n              and others plagued with unusual long term consequences\n              - we'll unravel the science behind one of nature's\n              most mysterious phenomena. New discoveries in\n              lightning science and revolutionary brain imaging\n              technology reveal what really happens when it strikes\n              the human body.
