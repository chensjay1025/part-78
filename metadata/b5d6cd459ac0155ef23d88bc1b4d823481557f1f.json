Israel has set up an internal inquiry into its deadly attack last month on the Gaza-bound flotilla of humanitarian aid ships. The attack left eight Turks and one Turkish American dead. Meanwhile, Turkey, along with Brazil, negotiated a nuclear fuel swap agreement with Iran and then voted against a UN Security Council resolution last week that imposed another round of sanctions on Iran. Award-winning journalist and bestselling author Stephen Kinzer is out with a new book that looks back into history to make sense of some of these shifting alliances in the Middle East and to chart a new vision for US foreign policy in the region.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5d6cd459ac0155ef23d88bc1b4d823481557f1f","amp;dn":"Democracy+Now+-+14+jun+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5d6cd459ac0155ef23d88bc1b4d823481557f1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,214,205,69,154,192,21,94,242,61,136,188,27,77,130,52,129,85,127,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
