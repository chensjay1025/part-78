Led by brothers Tim and Jon Neufeld, Starfield's mature, modern worship rock tackles the complexities inherent in modern faith ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ dualities far too often glossed over by other artists with featherweight &quot;We love God&quot; choruses. Consider, for instance, the implications of the incredibly vulnerable falsetto in &quot;Something to Say,&quot; which acknowledges a doubt in the existence of God coming from a pure believer ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ dualistic, indeed. Other tracks, though more straightforward, are no less earnest. The first single, the peppy &quot;Rediscover You,&quot; contains everything that's right in modern worship ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ an immediately recognizable, singalong chorus, boastful guitar work, a call to action, and a personal plea for grace, all wrapped up in Ian Eskelin's glossy production work. &quot;Top of My Lungs&quot; represents more of the band's ready-for-congregation style, reaching to the rafters with Delirious?-esque arena rock. The album works just as successfully as a whole as it does as individually packaged songs, delivering a well-crafted, highly personal collection to impact congregations.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:955e670ac83252630529bb48538696e2539619be","amp;dn":"Starfield-The+Saving+One_%282010%29_192kbps-RASUNGOD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"955e670ac83252630529bb48538696e2539619be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,94,103,10,200,50,82,99,5,41,187,72,83,134,150,226,83,150,25,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
