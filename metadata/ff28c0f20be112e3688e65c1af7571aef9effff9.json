Columbus is a big wuss -- but when you're afraid of being eaten by zombies, fear can keep you alive. Tallahassee is an AK-toting, zombie-slaying' bad ass whose single determination is to get the last Twinkie on earth. As they join forces with Wichita and Little Rock, who have also found unique ways to survive the zombie mayhem, they will have to determine which is worse: relying on each other or succumbing to the zombies.\nIMDb Link............:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1156398/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1156398/&lt;/a&gt;\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nProbably one of the best comedies of 2009, Zombieland is a great film. I know I say this too often ... but if you haven't seen it, you really should. Chances are though, like 99.9% of the people who are downloading this will have already seen it and know it's brilliantly funny. I only ask those of you downloading it to try and share this film with others. My own parents thought it looked &quot;stupid and boring.&quot; Ten minutes into the film, they were laughing their asses off.\n\nFor those of you who play 'zombie video games', you'll be happy to find there are actually quite a few references to games like &quot;Resident Evil&quot;, &quot;Dead Rising&quot;, &quot;CoD: World at War&quot;, and &quot;Left 4 Dead&quot;. But also, the film pokes humor at plenty of 'serious zombie films' ... not that there's really much 'serious' in a zombie film, but I think you know what I mean.\n\nAny time I feel myself getting sick and tired of the continuous release of 'zombie movies' and 'zombie video games', I can remember lines from this film and it always makes me smile. If you're wondering, my favorite scene is from 44:45 to 45:45 (one minute) and consists of a short driving montage of discussions between the four characters, including my favorite which is when Abigail Breslin's &quot;Little Rock&quot; character is explaining to Woody Harrelson's &quot;Tallahassee&quot; character that Miley Cyrus is only 'Hannah Montana' when she's wearing the wig ... priceless comedy.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTrivia\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1. The cameo role (Bill Murray's role) was offered to a bunch of different stars, but first it was offered to Patrick Swayze who had to decline due to his battle with cancer. Some of the others who were offered the role: Mark Hamil, Joe Pesci, Kevin Bacon, and Jean Claude Van Damme.\n2. This film broke the record for Woody Harrelson's biggest opening weekend with over $24 million, but then like a month later, it was broken again when 2012 was released and made over $60 million. Hopefully, Woody doesn't take this personally -- we're really NOT paying more to see him get killed in 2012.\n3. According to the film, 'Columbus' has at least 32 rules for surviving in Zombieland, but only ten of them appear in the film.\n4. Originally, (according to a deleted scene), 'Columbus's second rule for surviving in Zombieland was 'Zip-Lock Bags' -- because one has enough problems surviving in Zombieland and moisture shouldn't be one of them. Har-Har. I'm glad they deleted that scene ... Double-Tap is a better second rule, and is a nice little reference to &quot;Call of Duty: World at War&quot;.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nScreen Shots\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------- &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/zmblnd1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/zmblnd1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/zmblnd2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/zmblnd2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/zmblnd3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/zmblnd3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/zmblnd4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/zmblnd4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/zmblnd5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/zmblnd5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/zmblnd6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/zmblnd6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/zmblnd7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/zmblnd7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/zmblnd8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/zmblnd8.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAdditional Info\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLike all my iPod torrents, these files have their ID3 tags preformatted for your ease!
