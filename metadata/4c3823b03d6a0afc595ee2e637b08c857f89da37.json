The Manifesto also predicted the ultimate downfall of the capitalist system.\n(Summary written by Gesine)\n\n\n\nOrignally written as a series of newspaper articles in 1847, Wage-Labour and Capital was intended to give a short overview, for popular consumption, of Marx's central threories regarding the economic relationships between workers and capitalists. These theories outlined include the Marxian form of the Labour Theory of Value, which distinguishes ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œlabourÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ from ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œlabour-powerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, and the Theory of Concentration of Capital, which states that capitalism tends towards the creation of monopolies and the disenfranchisement of the middle and working classes. The Theory of Alienation, which describes a dehumanising effect of capitalist production, in which an immediate social signifcance of labour to the worker is absent, is also touched upon. These theories were later elaborated in Volume 1 of Capital, published in 1867.\n\nThis edition of Wage-Labour and Capital, published in 1891, was edited and translated by Friedrich Engels, and remains one of the most widely read of Marx's works.\n\n(Description by Carl Manchester).\n\n\n\n\nAn M4B file is an audio file which can be bookmarked. This is the audio-book file type. These files can have chapter markers which can be skipped through as you would skip through files on a play list. They can have built in cover art and chapter images. They will remember where you left off each time you stop the file and come back to it . And variable speed settings on Ipods and a growing number of other mp3 players can be utilized by this file type. The ability to bookmark allows for as little as one large file instead of many small ones without the burden of fast forwarding to find your spot every time you resume listening or the fear of otherwise losing your place. The reduced number of files also makes browsing through your files to find your book and your place in it much less effort.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c3823b03d6a0afc595ee2e637b08c857f89da37","amp;dn":"Librivox+M4B+-+Communist+Manifesto+%26+Wage-Labour+and+Capital++by","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c3823b03d6a0afc595ee2e637b08c857f89da37","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,56,35,176,61,106,10,252,89,94,226,230,55,176,140,133,127,137,218,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
