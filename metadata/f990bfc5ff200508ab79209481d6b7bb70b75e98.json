All the other files inside are the original ones, not patched, so you should not have any problem with Antiviruses.\n\nIf you don't trust it, download the original Setup from RarLabs Site and copy the RarReg.key file in the install Dir (usually C:Program FilesWinRAR).\n\n\n                WinRAR - What's new in the latest version\n\n\n   Version 3.93\n\n   1. Bugs fixed:\n\n      a) in WinRAR 3.92 -xd:pathfolder switch could also exclude folders,\n         which path does not match the path specified in the switch\n         and only the folder name is the same as specified;\n      \n      b) switches -y -or did not work correctly together.

If after testing it you like it and it's useful for you, show your support buying it!\n\n\n\nEnjoy and remember to seed... :o)\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f990bfc5ff200508ab79209481d6b7bb70b75e98","amp;dn":"WinRAR+3.93+x86-x64+Pre+Regged","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f990bfc5ff200508ab79209481d6b7bb70b75e98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,144,191,197,255,32,5,8,171,121,32,148,129,214,183,187,112,183,94,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
