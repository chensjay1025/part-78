With each and every generation swearing to extract vengeance. This generation consists of Suraj Singh and his brother, Jai. While Jai leads the life of a gangster, Suraj is not inclined to violence at all. He meets with a young woman named Sapna, and both fall in love with each other. When he takes Sapna to be introduced to Jai and the rest of his family, he is told that he cannot marry Sapna, as she is the daughter of Oberoi. Sapna and Suraj are able to convince Jai and the rest of the Singh family to give up this enmity, and let them marry. Jai goes to meet Oberoi, and proposes marriage, and to his joy, Oberoi agrees, and both families start preparations for the marriage. Jai starts to relax and thinks about giving up his gangster-like life. It is then a group of men target him with automatic weapons, leaving him mortally wounded and hospitalized. When Suraj finds out, he is enraged, and decides to avenge his brother's injuries. He finds out that the assailants are none other than Oberoi's men, and he swears to bring an end to Oberoi and all of his family, including Sapna. And thus begins the vengeance of this generation\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/xa9O2Iz&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/xa9O2Iz&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/qtxfOSL&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/qtxfOSL&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/yUWvy0q&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/yUWvy0q&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/BPd5Wes&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/BPd5Wes&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/Xd7PLxD&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/Xd7PLxD&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/ESQUbd0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/ESQUbd0&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/QWCfGpA&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/QWCfGpA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/5fRxVVs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/5fRxVVs&lt;/a&gt;\n\nwe are on FaceBook, Post Your Request, suggestion, and find upcomming Release of Silver RG, you will find all Silver RG Encoders at FB Page so keep in touch\n\n \n\n:Greetz:\nTo All Silver RG Encoders, AllEncoders &amp; All Other P2P RGs\n\n:Note:\nMake sure its real Silver RG Release From Silver RG Member,A video sample is included in the folder for those who want to check quality and compatibility before downloading the whole movie.\n\nWe Are Looking For Early Access To Anything You Can Provide CAMS, TS, DVD Screeners, VHS Screeners, DVDRips, Direct Audio, Early Music Release, Anything You Can Provide Seedboxes, Accounts, Dedicated Servers - Contact Us @\n\n:Support:\nTook 5 Hours to Encode &amp; 24 Hours to Upload &amp; Seed\nTook 30 Minutes to Create Description/Screen Shots etc...\nTakes 10 Seconds to say &quot;Thank You&quot;, or 4 seconds to say &quot;Whoooo&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a70ed42a3d692c0ec3dc004245ba01bc522989cf","amp;dn":"Dushmani+%281995%29+Hindi+DVDRip+720p+x264+Manudil+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a70ed42a3d692c0ec3dc004245ba01bc522989cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,14,212,42,61,105,44,14,195,220,0,66,69,186,1,188,82,41,137,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
