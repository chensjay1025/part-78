Dani Keller wakes up on her Seattle houseboat, a headache building behind her eyes from the wine she drank at a party the night before. But on this particular Sunday morning, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s surprised to see that her husband, Ian, is not home. As the hours pass, Dani fills her day with small things. But still, Ian does not return. Irritation shifts to worry, worry slides almost imperceptibly into panic. And then, like a relentless blackness, the terrible realization hits Dani: HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gone.\n \nAs the police work methodically through all the logical explanationsÃ¢â‚¬â€heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hurt, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s run off, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been killedÃ¢â‚¬â€Dani searches frantically for a clue as to whether Ian is in fact dead or alive. And, slowly, she unpacks their relationship, holding each moment up to the light: from its intense, adulterous beginning, to the grandeur of their new love, to the difficulties of forever. She examines all the sins she canÃ¢â‚¬â€and cannotÃ¢â‚¬â€remember. As the days pass, Dani will plumb the depths of her conscience, turning over and revealing the darkest of her secrets in order to discover the hard truthÃ¢â‚¬â€about herself, her husband, and their lives together.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4e35184a4e614799777b0c2a9ece85ffb303c76","amp;dn":"He%27s+Gone+-+Deb+Caletti.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4e35184a4e614799777b0c2a9ece85ffb303c76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,227,81,132,164,230,20,121,151,119,176,194,169,236,232,95,251,48,60,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
