The concept was that the guitarists were given completely free reign. The group of guitarists chosen for this project reads like a virtual who's who of indie rock from the late 80s/early 90s. \n\nThere is a lot of fascinating music here, with styles ranging from ambient soundscapes to straight up rockin' grooves and everything in between, including the truly bizarre.\n\nThe names in brackets are the bands that the guitarists are associated with.\n\n\n\nGuitarrorists (1991):\n\n1.
