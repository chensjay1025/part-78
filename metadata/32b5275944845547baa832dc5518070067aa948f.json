Initially there is about seven and a half minutes of music with no voice-over.  Then for the rest of that half-hour comes a rebroadcast of a portion of yesterday's interview with James Delingpole.  After the half-hour break the show is live.\n\n\n\n\nScheduled Guests\n................\n\n[show description from the Infowars web site]\n\n\nAlex talks with Ian Freeman and Mark Edge  of the libertarian political talk show Free Talk Live broadcast from Keene, New Hampshire. Free Talk Live is part of the Free State Project, an effort to get at least 20,000 libertarian-leaning people to move to New Hampshire in order to make the state a stronghold for libertarian ideas. \n[from about 8:00 in hour 4, through the end of the show]\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.freetalklive.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.freetalklive.com/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://freestateproject.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://freestateproject.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nBob Chapman  of The International Forecaster checks in with his regular Friday economic news update. \n[ from about 10:00 in hour 3 through 5:00 in hour 4]\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://theinternationalforecaster.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://theinternationalforecaster.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nAlex covers the news and takes a number of calls.\n\n\n\nGary Franchi [not billed on the Infowars web site] visits from 26:00 in hour 2 through 5:00 in hour 3.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://restoretherepublic.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://restoretherepublic.com/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://restoretherepublic.com/top-stories/dont-tread-on-me-unifying-a-movement.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://restoretherepublic.com/top-stories/dont-tread-on-me-unifying-a-movement.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.donttreadonmemovie.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.donttreadonmemovie.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_torrents_info_PLEASE-READ.txt\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n\n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance.
