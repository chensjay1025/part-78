AboveTopSecret.com has nearly 200,000 registered members and gets millions of page views annually, Allin remarked, noting that it appeals to people who want to know what's really going on in the world. \n\nHe listed some popular topics from the website, including a thread about something strange hitting every seismograph in the US at the same time (link), another about an alleged NASA-affiliated astronomer deciphering an 'intelligent' signal from space (link), and one asserting that BP has never shown the main underwater oil leak (link). Allin talked about some conspiracies regarding the BP catastrophe, the use of toxic dispersants to dissolve the Gulf oil spill, and what insiders have told him about the &quot;lackadaisical&quot; and &quot;cheap as you can&quot; practices of the multinational oil company. \n\nAllin also briefly covered advanced mind control weapons, suppressed technologies, and the Robertson Panel (link), a CIA-sponsored group set up to manage the public's perception of UFOs and suppress media coverage of sightings. Several callers phoned in with their own interesting UFO-related stories to share. Joel in Salt Lake City claimed that his grandfather, a brigadier general, worked as a military assistant for Gordon Gray, an alleged member of the MJ-12 group. A caller named Mark recounted a UFO encounter he had when he was sixteen, specifically recalling the eerie silence that occurred before a gigantic black craft with red lights came over his grandparent's house in Kansas. \n\n\nWebsite(s):\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢abovetopsecret.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5934a3d55586ab49a4bacbbc472261d7112ec7bb","amp;dn":"Coast+to+Coast+AM+-+05-28-10+-+Alt+News%2C+Conspiracies+%26+Open+Lin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5934a3d55586ab49a4bacbbc472261d7112ec7bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,52,163,213,85,134,171,73,164,186,203,188,71,34,97,215,17,46,199,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
