Actually, Cummings  is the fall guy for a clever ring of Nazi spies, headed by above-suspicion American philanthropist Otto Kruger. Our hero goes on a cross-country chase after genuine saboteur Norman Lloyd, all the while pursued himself by the police. Along the way, he acquires a reluctant &quot;travelling companion&quot; in the form of Priscilla Lane, who at first despises Cummings  and intends to turn him over to the authorities at the first opportunity, but who gradually comes to realize that the boy is innocent. Alfred Hitchcock intended Saboteur  to be the American equivalent to his British The 39 Steps, employing such details as the solid-citizen villain, the handcuffed hero, the unwilling blonde heroine, and any number of stopovers with a variety of offbeat characters (a travelling &quot;freak&quot; show, a compassionate blind man, a grizzled old prospector who turns out to be one of the spies, etc.) \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0035279/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0035279/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nSubtitles\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-1005&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-1005&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nDirector:\nAlfred Hitchcock\n\n\n        Priscilla Lane\t ... \tPatricia 'Pat' Martin\n\n\tRobert Cummings\t... \tBarry Kane\n\n\tOtto Kruger\t... \tCharles Tobin\n\tAlan Baxter\t... \tFreeman\n\tClem Bevans\t... \tNeilson\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:44:19\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 712x544 1,31:1\nCodec : XviD MPEG-4 codec\nFPS : 25,00\nBitRate : 1611 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,17 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps\n\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b5beb0c2dcb06cab324776873fb6a47a8c07deb","amp;dn":"Saboteur+%281942%29+Priscilla+Lane+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b5beb0c2dcb06cab324776873fb6a47a8c07deb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,91,235,12,45,203,6,202,179,36,119,104,115,251,106,71,168,192,125,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
