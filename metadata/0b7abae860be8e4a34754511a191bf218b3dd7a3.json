Windows 8 Professional, Enterprise, and Ultimate allow for two physical processors, providing the best performance on these computers. Windows 8 Starter, Home Basic, and Home Premium will recognize only one physical processor.\nFinally, I have to say something about this Windows 8 system requirements. The disk space in Windows 8 system requirements is originally 16GB, however, I recommend you to leave about 50 GB disk space for Windows 8, for you must leave some space to install software in C:Program Files folder, and some space for Windows 8 voice recognition, cause this needs some space, voice files are always big.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b7abae860be8e4a34754511a191bf218b3dd7a3","amp;dn":"Windows+8+-+DVD+%28English%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b7abae860be8e4a34754511a191bf218b3dd7a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,122,186,232,96,190,142,74,52,117,69,17,161,145,191,33,139,61,215,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
