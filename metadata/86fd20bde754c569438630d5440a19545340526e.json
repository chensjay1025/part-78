How did it happen? Where did it come from? Now, experience the story of the movement that's driving our national dialogue against big government spending and a Constitution under assault. &quot;Tea Party: The Documentary Film&quot; follows the struggles of five grassroots individuals and their transformation from home town rally goers and rally organizers to national activists in the 912 March on Washington. In the process, the film reveals what is at the heart of this nationwide surge of civic engagement - a return to and respect for a Constitutionally limited government, personal responsibility and fiscal restraint at the Federal level.\n\nGoals for the Film\nThe film seeks to further the conversation about the principles of the movement among tea party activists and provide a compelling means to share the story with those on the outside who are looking to understand its true nature. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.teapartymovie.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.teapartymovie.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n---------\n\nTrailer at http://www.teapartymovie.com/trailer.html\n\n\nDownload and burn ISO image on a blank DVD+R using ImgBurn (free) or other DVD burning software.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86fd20bde754c569438630d5440a19545340526e","amp;dn":"Tea+Party%3A+The+Documentary+Film","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86fd20bde754c569438630d5440a19545340526e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,253,32,189,231,84,197,105,67,134,48,213,68,10,25,84,83,64,82,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
