The Doctor is worried; he's sure he has seen the face somewhere before, but how? There is only one thing for it: a trip in the TARDIS back to 1888, so the Doctor can find out from the artist himself.\n\nFormatted to work on iPods.\n\nJust the file this time. When I tried to up it the first time, it kept reading as 0/0, so I had to make a different one.\n\nTurns out this is 0/0 too. Odd.\n\nTo be honest, if you can find my copy of this on Demonoid, you're probably better off.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c0703dc5b6a2d8dd231425ff5a800ccc91140c4","amp;dn":"Doctor+Who+-+510+-+Vincent+and+the+Doctor+-+iPod+Compatible","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c0703dc5b6a2d8dd231425ff5a800ccc91140c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,7,3,220,91,106,45,141,210,49,66,95,245,168,0,204,201,17,64,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
