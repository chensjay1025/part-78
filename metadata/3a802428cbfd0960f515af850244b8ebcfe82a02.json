High schooler Frank Abagnale Jr. idolizes his father, \nwho's in trouble with the IRS. When his parents separate, Frank runs away to \nManhattan with $25 in his checking account, vowing to regain dad's losses and \nget his parents back together. Just a few years later, the FBI tracks him down \nin France; he's extradited, tried, and jailed for passing more than $4,000,000 \nin bad checks. Along the way, he's posed as a Pan Am pilot, a pediatrician, and \nan attorney. And, from nearly the beginning of this life of crime, he's been \npursued by a dour FBI agent, Carl Hanratty. What starts as cat and mouse becomes \nsomething akin to father and son.\n\n\nFULL DVD COPY, NO SRINK OR RIP THE MBITS off BULLSLACHA.
