With this instructive manual, players can learn to concentrate on one-, two- and three-move checkmates, focusing on their opponents' last moves and keeping alert to new possibilities, rather than getting blinded by previous calculations. Written by two experienced chess teachers, this volumes first 100 exercises concern checkmates in one move, while the remaining exercises represent game-like positions for checkmates in two and three moves. All are designed to increase a player's skill and speed analyzing and solving chess problems. This is an updated and expanded version of 202 Surprising Checkmates which was released in 1998.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:478e3578996a06d7c727c0cd6c7ea3562127c8da","amp;dn":"212+Surprising+Checkmates+%28Bruce+Albertson+%26amp%3B+Fred+Wilson%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"478e3578996a06d7c727c0cd6c7ea3562127c8da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,142,53,120,153,106,6,215,199,39,192,205,108,126,163,86,33,39,200,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
