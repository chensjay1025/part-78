The task manager provides the ability to kill offending applications, and includes an emergency &quot;end all&quot; widget to handle extreme scenarios.\nSystem Monitor: The system monitor can be enabled to record device usage history over a period of time (up to one week), such that you can determine what applications and usage patterns have the greatest impact on battery life. This feature is commonly used to help track down which applications are having major negative effects on battery life. The system monitor records CPU usage for each process, overall CPU usage, display usage, battery level, and battery charging status.\nInstaller: The installer enables you to install and uninstall applications quickly and conveniently. It can archive multiple versions of applications, such that you can backup your apps before an update and revert back to older versions afterward. This is useful in the not uncommon event the updated item is buggy or otherwise undesirable. Additionally, the Installer is designed to work much more efficiently than the standard Android application manager, and does not suffer the frustrating lag issues found in the default Android item when browsing through a large number of installed apps.\nDevice Information: The device information screens show detailed information about your Android device, including storage, capabilities, network state, and OS build information.\n\nINSTALLATION INSTRUCTION\nDownload the app\nInstall .apk file\nDone.\n\nTorrent is working checked on MMX CANVAS-2\n\nSpecial Thanks To Admin And Other Member of {AMRG} RELEASERS GROUP\n\nPlease Seed After Download...!!\n\n\nPlease comment !
