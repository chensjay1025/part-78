Even though the band isn't at the Beacon, this show is proof that they always bring something special for New York!\n\nBob Dylan's &quot;Blind Willie McTell&quot; is a perfect choice, considering that the Allmans helped popularize McTell's &quot;Statesboro Blues.&quot;  Check out the vocal harmonies on this cool addition to the ABB repertoire!  That was followed immediately by the first version of &quot;Egypt&quot; since 3/20/06, and this exotic-sounding instrumental has never sounded better!  This incredible jam is great to have back in rotation.  Wicked versions of &quot;Gilded Splinters&quot; and &quot;Woman Across The River&quot; finished off a first set that felt like a second set!\n\nSusan Tedeschi joined the band for two tunes to start the second set, performing Delaney and Bonnie's song &quot;Comin' Home&quot; and &quot;Lost Lover Blues.&quot;  As always, Susan's sultry vocals and stinging blues guitar licks added a lot to this show.  Check out the &quot;Southbound&quot; encore, where Susan takes an extra run at the guitar break.  The Cowboy classic &quot;All My Friends&quot; is appropriate for the annual NYC Peachhead Reunion, and it is played beautifully.\n\nThe highlight of the whole show might be the massive &quot;Mountain Jam&gt;Smokestack Lightning&gt;Mountain Jam&quot; sandwich, an epic journey that travels though many different musical landscapes before bringing it all back home for the big finish.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:383fe4eabba21c16ad94544e40b9264fb01759b7","amp;dn":"The+Allman+Brothers+-+LIVE+03%2F12%2F2010+%5B320k+MP3%5D+NYC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"383fe4eabba21c16ad94544e40b9264fb01759b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,63,228,234,187,162,28,22,173,148,84,78,64,185,38,79,176,23,89,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
