Right at the outset, they are given false names with an intention that they won't get too close and concentrate on the job instead. They are completely sure that the robbery is going to be a success. But when the police show up right at the time and the site of the robbery, panic spreads amongst the group members and one of them is killed in the subsequent shootout along with a few policemen and civilians. When the remaining people assemble at the premeditated rendezvous point (a warehouse), they begin to suspect that one of them is an undercover cop.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:841fd1bf3b0726f0af35a283f5b51f1dcea5d206","amp;dn":"Reservoir.Dogs.1992.NTSC.WS.DVDR-mEsSiAh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"841fd1bf3b0726f0af35a283f5b51f1dcea5d206","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,31,209,191,59,7,38,240,175,53,162,131,245,181,31,29,206,165,210,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
