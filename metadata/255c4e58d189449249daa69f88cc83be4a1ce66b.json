Their mission is a collaboration of the NASA, CSA, ESA  and Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â Ãƒï¿½Ã…Â¡Ãƒï¿½Ã‚ï¿½ space agencies and takes the crew to Venus, Mars, a close flyby of the Sun, JupiterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s moons of Io and Europa, SaturnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s moon of Titan, Pluto, and the fictional Comet Yano-Moore. Most of the planetary destinations the crew reaches are followed by a manned landing there. Prior to the mission large tanks of Hydrogen  were deposited in stable orbits around the planets to allow the crew to refuel to have sufficient delta-v for the multi-year mission.\n\nThe crew encounter many hardships and disappointments along the way. A Venus EVA that almost ends in disaster when the lander Orpheus encounters launch delays, a Titan probe that fails after deployment and the loss of samples from Jupiter's moon Io all test the crew's resolve. The most devastating blow comes when the ship's medical officer dies of solar radiation-induced cancer in Saturn orbit, forcing the crew to decide whether to continue the mission to Pluto, or abort and return to Earth. In the original British release, the crew decides to press on to Pluto, making history. The American version, broadcast on the The Science Channel, was trimmed for length, the crew deciding to turn back at this stage rather than continue. The programme is narrated by David Suchet.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Video]\nVideo format: PAL\nFPS: 25.000\nSize: 720 x 576\nVideo bitrate (kbps): 1694\nVideo codec: xvid\n2-pass-encoded: yes\nFast resizing: no\nDeinterlacer filter: -\nAntialiasing filter:  -\n\n[Audio 1]\nLanguage: English\nAudio codec: mp3\nMP3 quality: 2\nChannels: 2\nSample rate: 48000\nAudio bitrate (kbps): 128\nVolume rescaling: 2.509\nAudio filter:  -\n\n[Audio 2]\nLanguage: Spanish\nAudio codec: mp3\nMP3 quality: 2\nChannels: 2\nSample rate: 48000\nAudio bitrate (kbps): 128\nVolume rescaling: 1.218\nAudio filter: -\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:255c4e58d189449249daa69f88cc83be4a1ce66b","amp;dn":"Space+Odyssey%3A+Voyage+To+The+Planets+%5BDual+ENG%2FSPA%5D+%28HD+720p%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"255c4e58d189449249daa69f88cc83be4a1ce66b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,92,78,88,209,137,68,146,73,218,166,159,136,204,131,190,74,28,230,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
