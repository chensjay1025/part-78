Joining Blade on his mission are JC - a hacker with a secret to keep - and Jessica Cannon, a fiery rookie who can find her way into any secure facility.\n\nNotes:\nFonts and crosshair have been fixed. All D3D effects are working.\nThe game has a very high difficulty level and even on easiest settings it is quite hard to beat.\nTo prevent frustation I have also included my savegames that have some cheats unlocked.\nSeveral patches have been installed and a new &quot;Arena Mode&quot; has been added to the game which is quite nice if you want quick action.\n\nKnown Issues:\nNone.\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\nMac OS version: OS X 10.4.11\nMin. Processor: Intel Core Duo\nMin RAM: 1024 MB\nVideo RAM: 64 MB\nHarddisk space: 2,8 GB\n\n[/quote]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:887b70692e0f51b495d7387a4bdbe26339164b4a","amp;dn":"SiN+Episodes%3A+Emergence+%5BCider-Intel%5D+%5BMAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"887b70692e0f51b495d7387a4bdbe26339164b4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,123,112,105,46,15,81,180,149,215,56,122,75,219,226,99,57,22,75,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
