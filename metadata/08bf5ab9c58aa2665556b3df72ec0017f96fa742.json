I try to share information\n that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.\n NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as\n information.

What Really Happened is proud to be one of the oldest political blogs on the net.\nRivero runs the WhatReallyHappened radio show on GCN six days a week, and makes good use of his sharp wit to help his blog visitors and radio listeners not only to read/hear the news but to understand what IS really happening. \n\n===============================================================\n.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08bf5ab9c58aa2665556b3df72ec0017f96fa742","amp;dn":"What+Really+Happened+-+Mar+25+TH+%5Bsebaygo1%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08bf5ab9c58aa2665556b3df72ec0017f96fa742","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,191,90,185,197,138,162,102,85,86,179,223,114,236,0,23,249,111,167,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
