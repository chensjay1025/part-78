Well how come my emails got notes on a scandal\nIt's like Eve with the apple,\nA priest in the chapel\nOvercome by the devil's tackle\nI'm still shackling the bad til I know\nI'm such a hassle every time I let my thoughts go\nI get baffled so I hardly pause\nI just crossed seas with these gnarly broads\nCos it hurts me just to see what I finally lost\nSo I guess I'm just a fiend\nConsumed by the scene\nThe stage and the screens\nWhere it's just me and Keane\n\nAnd if I stop for a minute\nI think about things I really don't wanna know\nSo I guess I'm just a fiend\nConsumed by the scene\nAnd I'm the first to admit it\nWithout you I'm a liner stranded in an ice floe\nThe stage and the screens\nWhere it's just me and Keane\n\n\nDownload MP3 Audio:","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe4625fece1f22261259ee6ef2c6e0356d5e7fb5","amp;dn":"Keane+-+Stop+for+a+minute+%28Video+Oficial+in+HQ%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe4625fece1f22261259ee6ef2c6e0356d5e7fb5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,70,37,254,206,31,34,38,18,89,238,110,242,198,224,53,109,94,127,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
