Scanned through it and did not see any property of or anything like that, but i could have missed it.\n\ncredit IMAGiNE &amp; to all the people who made it possible for me to share this with everyone...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)\n\nUPLOAD DEDICATED TO redchaos2354, Motley Crue, jdpennington, BADASS, W1ck3d1nt3ntz, ceo54, DaRkReAlM, ghostman, karakurachow, megaplay, Emery1337x, SaM, geordieboy1979, timamirrockdude, Noir, Shedevil, bone111, JorgeMontana, BlueLady, xxxUniversalAbsurdityxxx, mc68, TheFalcon007, pardeep333, X, DR67, DiNGiE, xclusive666, pro2kon, EMUworld &amp; many, many more &amp; to all the awesome people who are sharing (ALL THE UPLOADERS, THE RIPPERS, THE SCENE GROUPS, ETC, THE WHOLE P2P COMMUNITY)***wish i could list everyone***Thank you very much everyone &amp; i mean EVERYONE even the CRITICIZERS :)\n\n*****help what we can with others in need...the world is ONE big family*****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d662fd6eaa90e27cf4cf5d5d4b0dee26fb00115e","amp;dn":"The+Losers+DVDSCR+XViD+-+IMAGiNE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d662fd6eaa90e27cf4cf5d5d4b0dee26fb00115e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,98,253,110,170,144,226,124,244,207,93,93,75,13,238,38,251,0,17,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
