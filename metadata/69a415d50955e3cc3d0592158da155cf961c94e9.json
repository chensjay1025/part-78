In the article &quot;The Spill, the Scandal, and the President&quot; Rolling StoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Tim Dickinson writes QUOTE &quot;Though George W. Bush paved the way for the catastrophe, it was Obama who gave BP the green light to drill.&quot; Dickinson explores how Interior Secretary Ken Salazar kept in place the oil industry-friendly environmental guidelines that Bush had implemented and ultimately let BP, an oil company with the worst safety record, to get away with murder.\n\n\n* Mine Workers Union and Families Sue to Open Federal Probe Into Deadly Massey Coal Mine Explosion\n\nJust a few weeks before the April 20th explosion on BPÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Deepwater Horizon rig in the Gulf, 29 coal miners died after an explosion at Massey EnergyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Upper Big Branch Mine in West Virginia. Although the Mine Safety and Health Administration has launched an investigation into the disaster, unlike the open federal investigation into the BP oil spill, the probe into Massey is taking place entirely behind closed doors. The United Mine Workers of America and families of victims killed in the West Virginia coal mine explosion recently filed suit in federal court to open up the federal investigation.
