Instead of preventing the robbery he makes his own withdrawal and pins it on the robber, Harry Reikle (Christopher Plummer). This angers the already sadistic Reikle, who exacts retribution the way he knows best. Plummer is fabulous as the psychopathic robber. The Silent Partner is a deft mixture of suspense and humor, with enough twists to keep one guessing until the very end.
