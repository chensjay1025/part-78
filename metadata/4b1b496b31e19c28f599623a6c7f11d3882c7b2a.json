The show is partnered with the Liberty Tree Radio and Militia Radio networks. It is popular amongst 9/11 truthers and the Internet's alternative media. It is also retransmitted by thousands of radio microtransmitters across the United States. The show is hosted by Bruce Hemming (&quot;Buckshot&quot;), and Marcus Jones (&quot;Captain Gringo&quot;). It was a great show and we recommend listening to it.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b1b496b31e19c28f599623a6c7f11d3882c7b2a","amp;dn":"The+Health+Wyze+Report+Staff+on+Buckshot%5C%27s+Survival+Hour","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b1b496b31e19c28f599623a6c7f11d3882c7b2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,27,73,107,49,225,156,40,245,153,98,58,108,127,17,211,136,44,123,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
