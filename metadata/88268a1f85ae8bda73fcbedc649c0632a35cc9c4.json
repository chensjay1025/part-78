You are only able to watch the replays of your games vs the AI if you have loaded the correct AI-Script. Meaning if you want to watch a replay from a match between you and a 6.1 AI you have to select the 6.1 AI script, start a game, exit the game and then select the replay you wish to watch. So if you update to a newer version of the A.I-script and want to watch an old replay you HAVE to load the old A.I-script first.  \nAfter new patch is released replays won't work untill you download the latest cache file\nLink http://www.sc2win.com/starcraft-2-downloads/starcraft-2-cache-files-update/\n\n6)Difficulty can be changed using laucher itself but some times it won't change so you need to do it manually ke you did in previous step\nP.S I recommend you to play strategy 0.22 ai as it will truely test your skills\n\n7)Enjoy playing starcraft 2 aand if you wanna watch some starcraft 2 videos with commentary I recommend to subscribe to the following channels\nfavourite)\n\n\n\nDon't forget to say thanks\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88268a1f85ae8bda73fcbedc649c0632a35cc9c4","amp;dn":"Starcraft+2+Launcher+Pack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88268a1f85ae8bda73fcbedc649c0632a35cc9c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,38,138,31,133,174,139,218,115,252,190,220,100,156,6,50,163,92,201,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
