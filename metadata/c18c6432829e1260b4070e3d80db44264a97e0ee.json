On a stifling hot Christmas       \n      night in 1803, 23-year-old William Buckley, a young English        \n   convict, escapes from the doomed first settlement of Port Phillip     \n      Bay in South Eastern Australia, choosing instead to risk the       \n   unknown of the hostile Australian wilderness rather than surrender    \n   his freedom. Thirty two years later, in 1835, a wild looking white    \n     man emerges from the Australian bush with long hair, a beard,       \n    dressed in skins and carrying spears. It's William Buckley, long     \n   presumed dead. His account, of living for thirty-two years with an    \n     Aboriginal tribe before white colonisation, is a tale of love,      \n   violence, mortality and loyalty. It's one of the greatest survival    \n        stories ever told.A former soldier, William Buckley was          \n   transported to Australia for receiving a bolt of stolen cloth. But    \n     rather than face a life in shackles, he escaped from the first      \n    settlement of Port Phillip Bay. Months later and on the point of     \n    starvation, Buckley fatefully takes a spear from a recently dug      \n     grave to use as a crutch.When a group of Wathaurong Aborigines      \n   discover him they believe he is the warrior Murrangurk, the owner     \n   of the spear, returned from the dead. He is taken in by the family    \n       of Murrangurk. Marrangurk's brother Torrenauk becomes his         \n   'brother'. Over the years, Buckley becomes a Wathaurong tribesman,    \n    learning to hunt and fish and speak their language. He witnesses     \n    many battles, cannibalism and various tribal customs. He endures     \n     hardship - tragically losing his family in a clan killing, and      \n     finds great happiness - falling in love with a young woman who      \n                     stays with him for many years.                      \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                                                                       \n                                                                         \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n                                                                \n             \n                                                                           \n                                                                          \n                                                                          \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                                                                           \n                                                                            \n                                                                    \n                                             \n                                              \n                                                      \n                                                         \n                                    \n                                                        \n                                                                            \n                \n                                                                  \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n                                                                         \n                                                                       \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                                 Enjoy                                   \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                                                                        \n                                                                      \n                                                                        \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n                                                                  \n                \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n                                                                          \n                                                                         \n                                                                           \n                                                                           \n                                                                         \n                                                                           \n                                                                           \n                                                                            \n                                                                           \n                                                     \n                                      \n                                              \n                                                     \n                                        \n                                    \n                                                             \n                                                                         \n                \n                                                                   \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n                                                                         \n                                                                       \n           Shell &amp;
