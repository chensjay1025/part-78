There is a lively, fun, and refreshing intimacy to these sides, as McGhee, accompanied by Bull City Red on washboard and occasional second guitar from Buddy Moss, delivers a set of folk blues filled with obvious joy. His first pairing with Terry on harmonica, &quot;Workingman's Blues,&quot; is here, as well as tracks where Jordan Webb handles the harp duties. McGhee and company deliver a whole lot of whooping and stomping in an endearing street-corner style.\n\n\n\n1  Key to My Door 2:49\n2  Million Lonesome Woman 2:36 \n3  Ain't No Tellin' 2:54 \n4  Try Me One More Time 3:03 \n5  I Want to See Jesus 2:32\n6  Done What My Lord Said 2:34 \n7 I Want King Jesus 3:00 \n8 What Will I Do (Without the Lord) 2:37 \n9 Key to the Highway 3:31 \n10 I Don't Believe in Love 3:03 \n11So Much Trouble 2:45\n12 Good-Bye Now 2:53 \n13 Jealous of My Woman 2:51 \n14 Unfair Blues 2:48 \n15 Barbecue Any Old Time 2:49 \n16 Workingman's Blues 2:49 \n17 Sinful Disposition Woman 2:36\n18 Back Home Blues 2:57 \n19 Deep Sea Diver 2:41 \n20 It Must Be Love 2:57 \n21 Swing, Solider, Swing 2:2\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd5e5683e8d6c83f88c2f5225c2698d122752552","amp;dn":"Brownie+McGhee+-+Back+Home+Blues+%28blues%29%28mp3%40320%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd5e5683e8d6c83f88c2f5225c2698d122752552","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,94,86,131,232,214,200,63,136,194,245,34,92,38,152,209,34,117,37,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
