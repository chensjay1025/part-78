Instead of admitting his guilt, the detective is given an unexpected alibi, but this &quot;solution&quot; only multiplies the emotional complexity and guilt over his partner's death. He's also still got a murder to solve, in addition to the blackmail and framing of an innocent bystander being orchestrated by the man they were chasing. There's also a local detective (Swank) who is conducting her own personal investigation... of his partner's death. Will it all come crashing down on him?     \n\n\nCast:\nAl Pacino - Will Dormer\nRobin Williams - Walter Finch\nHilary Swank - Ellie Burr\n\n\nVideo:\nResolution - 688x356\nFramerate - 23.976fps\nPixel Shape - 40:33(NTSC 16:9)\nVideo Structure - Progressive\nDisplay - 16:9 Wide\nAverage Bitrate - 5.58 mbps\n\nAudio:\nDolby Digital 5.1-ch English\nStereo,48000hz,96kbps\n\nLanguage: English\nSubs: None","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76bfd91c529265273108f5cb79fa485628b304f9","amp;dn":"Insomnia+%28DVDrip-+Mp4%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76bfd91c529265273108f5cb79fa485628b304f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,191,217,28,82,146,101,39,49,8,245,203,121,250,72,86,40,179,4,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
