Yes it's pronounced GE dude. I used to work for the evil empire until they sold my department during the current \nrecession. We made about 20 million a year for them in a deartment of 15 people, but I guess we we're quite an asset that had to be let go to recover some of the money for all their other bad financial decisions. Anyway todays show...\n\n-----------------------------\n\nIn the first hour Jack makes a reference and plays a clip from an interview with Daniel Ellsberg that took place on 2006-07-14.
