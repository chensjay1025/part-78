Working for different companies, they are prepared to do almost anything ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ legal or illegal ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ to close a sale. BB buys a shiny Cadillac to maintain his image of success and almost immediately crashes into another Cadillac driven by Tilley (all &quot;tin men&quot; drive a Cadillac). It is not clear who is at fault for the accident (BB is entering the public way from the dealer, in reverse but very slowly; Tilley has the right of way, however, he was clearly distracted). This generates a spate of road rage and the two rivals vow to do anything to get back at the other.\n\n\n\nMain cast\n\n    * Richard Dreyfuss as Bill &quot;BB&quot; Babowsky\n    * Danny DeVito as Ernest Tilley\n    * Barbara Hershey as Nora Tilley\n    * John Mahoney as Moe Adams\n    * Jackie Gayle as Sam\n    * Seymour Cassel as Cheese\n    * Bruno Kirby as Mouse\n    * Michael Tucker as Bagel (the same character he portrayed in the film Diner)\n    * J.
