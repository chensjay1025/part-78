In the case of these stirring selections from the Lomax archives, among this country's richest cultural resources was the black population enslaved on southern plantations and penal farms. \n\nEvident here are echoes of lost worlds--the eerie sounding call of a Mississippi ferryman, the mystery of Charlie Butler's stunning &quot;Diamond Joe,&quot; and the fierce spirituality of &quot;If I Had My Way I'd Tear the Building Down&quot; by Reverend C.H. Savage and congregation. Most extraordinary are the performances by Sid Hemphill, who Alan Lomax said was his greatest discovery. Playing the ancient pre-harmonica quills or panpipes, whooping with primal fervor, his ingenious &quot;Emmaline, Take Your Time&quot; anticipates Hemphill's unreleased fife-and-drum masterpiece, &quot;The Devil's Dream.&quot; --Alan Greenberg\n\nThe Deep River of Song series focuses on work songs, ballads, spirituals, blues shouts, and all kinds of story songs. A companion volume to Deep River of Song: The Blues Lineage, which presented field recordings by Son House, Muddy Waters, and many other Delta bluesmen, Saints &amp; Sinners presents a good look at the musical climate of rural Mississippi during the early 20th century. Listeners are given an ample view of the atmosphere of the times, which was much closer to the days of slavery than many blues fans realize. \n\nThe names known best to Delta aficionados are Sid Hemphill and Dobie Red, though much of the best material comes from the many contributors who never made it to a studio; Alec Askew, Crap Eye, Rev. C.H. Savage, Henry Joiner and Deacon Tom Jones are just a few of the mysterious names whose sparse recordings lend a ghostly air to the proceedings. For those captivated by the mystery of many selections from Harry Smith's Anthology of American Folk Music, Saints &amp; Sinners is a vital addition to their library. - Earl Simmons, All Music Guide\n\nRecorded between 1936 and 1942. \n\nPerformers include: Big Charlie Butler, Lucious Curtis &amp; Willie Ford, Thomas &quot;Jaybird&quot; Jones, Joe Shores, Jim Henry, Sid Hemphill, Alec Askew, Will Head, Will Starks, Crap Eye, Jeff Webster, Joe Miller, Dobie Red, Frank Evans, Rev.
