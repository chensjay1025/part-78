Fluid displacement can make an area vulnerable to quake activity-- such as when companies drill deeply for oil, he noted. Strong hurricanes this year, category 3 or higher, may be good or bad for the oil spill, possibly taking the oil out to sea or causing it to surge up the East Coast, he outlined. \n\nCharged particles that we call solar flares or coronal mass ejections &quot;have an intricate interaction with Earth&quot; that can affect our magnetic field and weather, he said. NASA scientists have recently sent out a press release highlighting possible dangers from increased solar activity as we head into the Solar Maximum (which peaks in 2012). There are signs of a possible magnetic pole shift related to changes occurring within the Earth's core, Battros added. \n\nThe Mayans spoke of a time of galactic alignment arriving in 2012, which Battros correlated with new scientific findings about bands of charged particles coming toward us from within the Milky Way galaxy. He conjectured that the Mayan civilization may be far older than what is typically thought, and observed long galactic cycles that repeat over thousands of years. \n\nBilderberg Update\nFirst hour guest, radio host Alex Jones reported on the Bilderberg meeting taking place in Spain. &quot;This is the first time that a large portion of the Bilderberg group could not even come to the event because there was so much international coverage,&quot; said Jones, who considers this a victory of sorts. According to his multiple sources, the attending Bilderberg members have greenlighted an attack on Iran sometime in the next year. \n\n\nWebsite(s):\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢earthchangesmedia.com\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢prisonplanet.com\nVideo(s):\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Endgame\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Terrorstorm\nBook(s):\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Solar Rain\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Global Warming: A Convenient Disguise","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94e72bb1c471942d16fa19cd1b93f3737bd6b1d9","amp;dn":"Coast+to+Coast+AM+-+06-07-10+-+Earth+Changes+%26+Solar+Activity","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94e72bb1c471942d16fa19cd1b93f3737bd6b1d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,231,43,177,196,113,148,45,22,250,25,205,27,147,243,115,123,214,177,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
