But it \n       takes our brain around a hundred and fifty milliseconds to process \n       what we see. We're not aware of this time lag going on, but in \n       those few milliseconds, there are extraordinary things happening \n       that completely pass us by.\n       \n       But what if we could break through this speed limit? Bend and \n       stretch time in ways never thought possible. What new marvels \n       would we see?\n       \n       Now, using the latest high-speed cameras, Richard takes us on a \n       journey beyond our eye's limits, letting us see secrets hidden in \n       every element of our planet.\n       \n       A world where thin air can shatter rock.\n       \n       And water can tear through metal.\n       \n       A world where the fastest thing on earth lies right beneath our \n       feet.\n       \n       And where a spectacular celestial display is finally captured, \n       even though many have claimed it doesn't even exist.\n\n\n                             Big up all scene massive!\n\n\n    \n                                       \n                GROUP  INFORMATION          \n         9 Years of the Force and still    \n                      going strong                  \n     \n\n           What we are looking for:\n\n           * gigabit euro sites for x264 only\n           * Fios x264 rippers or cappers\n           * also we have a contest to annouce we are in need of a\n           * new nfo ascii artwork design email us with your designs\n           * winners artwork will be added as our new nfo\n           * dont forget to tag your work\n           * If you think you can help contact us on irc\n           * or email us at &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;682e071a0b0d28001d1b00460901&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aaf62485494220be9ac01958d9516ec911fbe024","amp;dn":"Richard.Hammonds.Invisible.Worlds.S01E01.720p.HDTV.x264-aAF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aaf62485494220be9ac01958d9516ec911fbe024","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,246,36,133,73,66,32,190,154,192,25,88,217,81,110,201,17,251,224,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
