This not an actual playlist which you may be used to.\n\nMultiple genres are featured, some older unknown tracks, something newer and great local bands from both of us have been included.\n\nThis is a compilation which is made by analizing the single tracks and putting them in a specific order how we think it would fit together.\n\nOne more thing to say, support the artists themselves, not us. The playlist makers are not supposed to be sponsored in any kind for what they are doing.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                      VA - Snipe The Hype vol.1\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Various Artists\nAlbum................: Snipe The Hype vol.1\nGenre................: Indie\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 2010\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Samsung CD-R/RW SW-224\nCodec................: LAME 3.93\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Extreme, (avg. bitrate: 230kbps)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 hz\nTags.................: ID3 v1.1, ID3 v2.3\nInformation..........: \n\nRipped by............: daKradha, Samy on 1.5.2010\nPosted by............: daKradha, Samy on 1.5.2010\nNews Server..........: \nNews Group(s)........: \n\nIncluded.............: NFO, SFV, PLS, M3U\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   1.
