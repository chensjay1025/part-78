Bon viveur, satirist,\nand Shelly's literary executor.\n\n'He was sent, as usual, to a public school, where a\nlittle learning was painfully beaten into him, and\nfrom thence to the university, where it was carefully\ntaken out of him.'\n\nShelly introduced him into the radical literary set;\nwhom he satirised for the rest of his life. He wrote\nnovels of ideas set against guests in country houses.\nThe best are 'Headlong Hall' and 'Nightmare Abbey'.\n\nHis set pieces and word play were adopted by Tom Stoppard.\nIt's no coincidence if the setting, and lines like: 'I\nalmost think it is the ultimate destiny of science to\nexterminate the human race', remind you of, say,\nStoppard's 'Arcadia'.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54a29a6077356133fdc3aad13cfe55f3bb1ce614","amp;dn":"BBC+R4+-+Thomas+Love+Peacock%5C%27s+%5C%27Headlong+Hall%5C%27+sp7","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54a29a6077356133fdc3aad13cfe55f3bb1ce614","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,162,154,96,119,53,97,51,253,195,170,209,60,254,85,243,187,28,230,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
