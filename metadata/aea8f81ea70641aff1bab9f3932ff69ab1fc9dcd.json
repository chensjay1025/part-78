That is correct. No one can guarantee top 10 rankings except for Google's engineers.\n\nHowever, our tool IBP has a success rate of more than 98% and we will give you your money back if you belong to the very few people who don't get top 10 rankings on Google with IBP.\n\nHow does it work in detail?\n\n1. You choose the keyword and the search engine\n\nYou tell IBP for which keyword you want to get a top 10 position and you choose the search engine on which you want to have a top 10 position. This can be Google.com, Google.co.uk, many other local Google variations as well as Yahoo, Bing, their local variations and many other search engines.\n\n2. IBP analyzes your web page\n\nIBP's Top 10 Optimizer will then analyze all the relevant ranking elements on your web page and the links to your website and calculate a ranking score based on that information. The higher the ranking score, the more likely it is that your website will be listed on Google's first result page.\n\n3. IBP tells you in detail what you have to change\n\nIf your website does not have a 100% score, IBP will tell you in plain English what exactly you have to do to improve your web page and the links to your site. The advice will be tailored to your website, the chosen search engine and the chosen keyword. IBP will tell you in detail what you have to change and how you have to change it.\n\n4. You make the changes on your web page\n\nIn the last step, you change your web page according to the suggestions of IBP's Top 10 Optimizer until there are no further suggestions (IBP's Top 10 Optimizer gives your site a 100% rating).\n\nThat's it. No catch, no strings attached. If you follow the advice of IBP's Top 10 Optimizer then your website will be listed on Google's first result page.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aea8f81ea70641aff1bab9f3932ff69ab1fc9dcd","amp;dn":"Internet+Business+Promoter+%28IBP%29+11.7.4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aea8f81ea70641aff1bab9f3932ff69ab1fc9dcd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,168,248,30,167,6,65,175,241,186,185,243,147,47,246,154,177,252,157,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
