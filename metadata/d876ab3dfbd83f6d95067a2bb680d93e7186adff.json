What Kate doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know is itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s really the beginning of a nightmare. After one short meeting with the legendary murderer, she becomes the object of his desire.\n\nBrad Jericho became the prison warden to keep an eye on the man whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d killed his sister, to make sure Ramsey paid with his life. But when the killer targets a sexy reporter, Brad canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t step back and do nothing. It doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t matter that Ramsey lives in a prison cell. Brad knows the man isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t an ordinary convict. If Ramsey wants to kill Kate badly enough, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find a way.\n\nDanger sparks a shared desire that neither can deny, and if Kate can avoid becoming RamseyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s next victim, they might just have a chance.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d876ab3dfbd83f6d95067a2bb680d93e7186adff","amp;dn":"Now_You_See_Me_by_Rachel_Carrington.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d876ab3dfbd83f6d95067a2bb680d93e7186adff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,118,171,61,251,216,63,109,149,6,122,43,182,128,217,62,113,134,173,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
