The goal now is to unstuck it and resume later today.  However, the relief wells that wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be ready until at least August still offer the best (and only proven) hope. While we wait, others are asking why supertankers arenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t being used to suck up the spill.\n\nOil has now begun washing ashore in Alabama and Mississippi. Next in line: Florida. President Obama must now come to terms with the pitfalls of believing BP had the crap together despite the horrendous track record of Big Oil. Criminal investigations are underway. And movie director James Cameron finds himself with a seat at the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œhow the hell do we stop this thingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ table.\n\nMeanwhile, Arizona governor Jan Brewer will be meeting with Obama tomorrow to discuss immigration. If all the undocumented immigrants just disappeared, Arizona would face approximant losses of $26.4 billion in economic activity, $11.7 billion in gross state product, and 140,324 jobs. And in spite of the lazy and often race-based rhetoric, the facts show that providing a path to legalization would boost the economy and create jobs.\n\nAlso today, Alaska newspaper warns a Sarah Palin biographer that ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAlaska has a law that allows the use of deadly force in protection of life and propertyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ then apologizes for any misunderstanding of the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcatchy endingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. That catchy ending dovetails nicely with the death threats author Joe McGinniss has been receiving.\n\nPlus, Al and Tipper call it quits. And screw it - force me out if you can... more and more people are opting to go into foreclosure and stay in their homes.\n\nThese stories, your calls, and much more on todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Randi Rhodes Show!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f1ad378c2af824fcbd694eb452958f64c64ccf2","amp;dn":"Randi+Rhodes+Show+-+June+02+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f1ad378c2af824fcbd694eb452958f64c64ccf2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,26,211,120,194,175,130,79,203,214,148,235,69,41,88,246,76,100,204,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
