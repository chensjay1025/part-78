Lee Marvin plays Major Reisman, assigned to coordinate a suicide mission on a French chateau held by top Nazi officers. Since no &quot;normal&quot; GI can be expected to volunteer for this mission, Reisman is compelled to draw his personnel from a group of military prisoners serving life sentences. This &quot;dirty dozen&quot; includes a sex pervert (Telly Savalas), a psycho (John Cassavetes), a retarded killer (Donald Sutherland), and the equally malevolent Charles Bronson, Trini Lopez, Jim Brown, and Clint Walker. On the dim promise of receiving pardons if they survive, the criminals undergo a brutal training program, then are marched behind enemy lines dressed as Nazi soldiers, the better to overtake the chateau and kill everyone in it--including the innocent wives and mistresses of the German officers.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                    \n                    PLEASE,DON'T FORGET TO SEED AT LEAST 1,5","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e313158dcc4947d5fc6af5ec813c5562c4858613","amp;dn":"The.Dirty.Dozen.CUSTOM.PAL.DVDR.GLADiAT0R","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e313158dcc4947d5fc6af5ec813c5562c4858613","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,19,21,141,204,73,71,213,252,106,245,236,129,60,85,98,196,133,134,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
