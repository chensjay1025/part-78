The series was set in the year 2050 and concentrates on the space ship Ilea in semi-permanent orbit above the space city Callisto. The Ilea was home to a university and many of the programme's main plot strands revolved around the lives of the students, helping the programme to deal with more down-to-earth issues despite its unearthly setting. A secondary plot dealt with an attempt to travel to the stars known as the Daedalus Project.\n\nThe series was created and produced by William Smethurst, a former long standing editor of British Radio Soap The Archers, and was recorded at the studios of Central Television in Birmingham.\n\nActors included Lucy Benjamin, Anna Chancellor, Jason Durr Fay Masterson and Fiona Sinnott\n\n\nThanks to emaureen at thebox.bz\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8755e1450665d3f7f8b6c9acaa30033675746ddf","amp;dn":"Jupiter+Moon+01+March+1990","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8755e1450665d3f7f8b6c9acaa30033675746ddf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,85,225,69,6,101,211,247,248,182,201,172,170,48,3,54,117,116,109,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
