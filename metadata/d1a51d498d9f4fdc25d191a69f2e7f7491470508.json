In this particular case, the story \n\nrevolves around a young and idealistic politician from Salvador, whom the enemies are eager to eliminate.&quot;\n\n&quot;When watching &quot;Tocaia no Asfalto&quot; you consequently ask yourself: Where has Brazilian and specially Baiano Cinema gone? It's \n\na simple naive story trapped in a beautiful movie. The characters are crude and the theme is kinda dated, but everything is \n\nrecognizable. The beautiful landscape from Salvador appear as never seen since previous &quot;a Grande Feira&quot; in all it's beauty. \n\nThe innocence of the Hit-man - that won't shoot his victim and consequently save his life because he is inside a church - is \n\nvery humane. After seen this very significant piece of Brazilian Cinema, I wonder if there shouldn't be more of it. Why has \n\nit stopped? It looks promising - maybe even more than other cinemas from other countries - but where is it? It faded, just \n\nlike the life of the hit-man. Perhaps that's the problem. We where as innocent as he was.&quot; Quotes from IMDB.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nCast\nAgildo Ribeiro\t\t\nArassary de Oliveira\t\t\nAdriano Lisboa\t\t\nGeraldo Del Rey\t\t\nAngela Bonatti\t\t\nDavid Singer\t\t\nJurema Penna\t\t\nAntonio Pitanga\t\t(as Antonio Luiz Sampaio)\nRoberto Ferreira\t\t\nMaria Anita\t\t\nHÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©lio Rodrigues\t\t\nMilton Gaucho\t\t\nMaria Ligia\t\t\nOthon Bastos\t\t\nSilvio Lamenha\t\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nFile Name:                                      Tocaia.no.Asfalto.Roberto.Pires.1962.TVRip.XviD.MP3.MKO.avi                   \n\n  \nFile Size (in bytes):                           1,067,670,180                     \nDuration (hh:mm:ss):                            1:40:26                \n                                                                                \nVideo Codec Type(e.g. &quot;DIV3&quot;):                  XVID              \nVideo Codec Name(e.g. &quot;DivX 3, Low-Motion&quot;):    XviD ISO MPEG-4              \nFrame Width/Frame Height (pixels):              560/416   \nFrames Per Second:                              23.976          \nVideo Bitrate (kbps):                           1277                 \nMPEG-4, MPEG-2:                                 [MPEG-4][]  \nB-VOP, QPEl, GMC, NVOP, H264:                   [B-VOP][][][][]             \nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:              0.229&quot;                     \n                                                                                \nNumber of Audio Streams:                        1       \nAudio Codec (e.g. &quot;AC3&quot;):                       0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3                   \nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):                         44100             \nAudio Bitrate(kbps):                            128                 \nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):            CBR            \nAudio Channel Count (e.g. &quot;2&quot; for stereo):      2 \n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nTocaia.no.Asfalto.Roberto.Pires.1962.TVRip.XviD.MP3.MKO","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1a51d498d9f4fdc25d191a69f2e7f7491470508","amp;dn":"Tocaia+no+Asfalto+%28Roberto+Pires%2C+1962%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1a51d498d9f4fdc25d191a69f2e7f7491470508","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,165,29,73,141,159,79,220,37,209,145,166,159,46,127,116,145,71,5,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
