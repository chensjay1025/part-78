Biggs makes new revelations regarding the death of his late friend and former Rolling Stone contributing editor Michael Hastings. The journalist died June 18 when his Mercedes exploded so powerfully that first responders found its four-cylinder engine over 100 feet from the car. Los Angeles police and firefighters have since been ordered not to discuss the &quot;accident.&quot; \n\nMarilu Henner, star of the hit TV sitcom Taxi and author of Total Health Makeover, joins the broadcast to discuss her ability to remember every minor detail in her life, a genetic trait called Highly Superior Auto-Biographical Memory. [The second half of hour two is largely an &quot;infomercial&quot; for Youngevity products that Jones and Henner promote.]\n\nIn Los Angeles, an anti-Zimmerman mob stormed a Wal-Mart, assaulting shoppers and starting fires. Overall, rioting has not been as widespread as some feared prior to the trial. \n\nRock musician Ted Nugent is also on the show to expose how gun grabbers are taking advantage of Travyon Martin's death for a new assault on the Second Amendment.\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential \n to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a\n spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the &quot;big \n picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media \n for news and info is a prescription for ignorance.
