Yes this is a diffferent band, whereas the two major forces of Lindisfarne, Hull and Jackson remain, a rockier outfit join the line-up. The original band were a terrific folk-rock band, whereas this may be more rock-folk, if such a definition can exist. There are plenty of accoustic guitars and mandolins remain, but with a heavier bass, which Tommy Duffy plays with some melodic meat, more powerful electric guitar sounds from Charlie Harcourt and fine rock-style drumming from Paul Nichols. Add the late-Kenny Craddock's keyboards and additional electric and accoustic guitars to the mix and the Mk 2 make a fine sound. The songs are not ponderous, but the slower songs have feeling, such as Hull's, &quot;When The War Is Over&quot; and a particular favourite, &quot;Roll On River&quot;, sung really well by Ray Jackson. There are some orchestral arrangements added, which is on a grander scale than the original line-up's albums, but certainly adds to the flavour, such as &quot;Roll On River&quot;. Duffy and Craddock are able to write catchy songs in this case almost as well as Alan Hull. This album is not dull, but an absolute joy. This was an over-looked album, because of the rockier sounds around at the time and that the Mk 1 band was so well loved. Lastly, I saw this Mk 2 Lindisfarne perform much of this album at the Rainbow and they didn't disappoint. \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba591b72422252b67a6d737210f3286c0b1d122a","amp;dn":"Lindisfarne...Roll+on+Ruby%281973%29cd%282005%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba591b72422252b67a6d737210f3286c0b1d122a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,89,27,114,66,34,82,182,122,109,115,114,16,243,40,108,11,29,18,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
