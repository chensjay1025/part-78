Each 60-minute episode profiles one or two interventions where a psychological or psychiatric clinician specializing in hoarding behavior and a crew of professional cleaners assists a hoarder with the cleanup of his or her home over a period of two or three days, often enlisting the help of the hoarder's family and friends. In most instances, the intervention is prompted by a crisis, such as the threat of eviction or the removal of minor children from the home. The first episode aired August 17, 2009 at 10PM ET.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d88c998f7e0b2cec4aefe005e5fdccf90d2fbfa9","amp;dn":"Hoarders+Season+2+Episode+9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d88c998f7e0b2cec4aefe005e5fdccf90d2fbfa9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,140,153,143,126,11,44,236,74,239,224,5,229,253,204,249,13,47,191,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
