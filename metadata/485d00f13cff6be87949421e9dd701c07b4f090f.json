After splitting from the group, he became a solo artist, releasing his self-titled debut in 1982. The follow-up, Akimbo Alogo (1984), was his most successful album; featuring the single &quot;Go for Soda,&quot; it went double platinum in Canada. Four albums followed: Shakin' like a Human Being (1986), Rockland (1989), I Am a Wild Party (1990) and Aural Fixations (1992). \n\nThis is an awesome CD. One which captures a sound that none of his later albums could compare to IMHO.\n\nWorkablob","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:485d00f13cff6be87949421e9dd701c07b4f090f","amp;dn":"Kim+Mitchell+1982+EP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"485d00f13cff6be87949421e9dd701c07b4f090f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,93,0,241,60,255,107,232,121,73,66,30,157,215,1,192,123,79,9,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
