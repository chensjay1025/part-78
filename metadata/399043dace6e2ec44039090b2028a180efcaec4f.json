When Japanese forces swept across asia they reached Papua New Guinea which was than part of Australia very quickly. There the Japanese forces attempted to march cross country to the capital of Port Moresby. Japanese and under-trained under-armed Australian forces met at the village of Kokoda in the Owen Stanley Ranges and thus started one of the most difficult and bloody battles of the Pacific war.\n\nThis is a graphic honest depiction which is not suitable for children. It includes realistic reenactment and interviews with historians and veterans from both sides. It is an honest depiction of war, warts, canibalism, petty politics, backstabbing and all.\n\nI recommend this for all Australians Kiwis and Japanese, but if you are American or English you might not like the truth.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:399043dace6e2ec44039090b2028a180efcaec4f","amp;dn":"Kokoda+S01E01","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"399043dace6e2ec44039090b2028a180efcaec4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,144,67,218,206,110,46,196,64,57,9,11,32,40,161,128,239,202,236,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
