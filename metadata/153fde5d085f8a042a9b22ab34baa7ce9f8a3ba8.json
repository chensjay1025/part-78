You'll learn how to organize your model into hierarchies and keep your scene clean and efficient.\n\nWeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll also take a look at several modeling tools, including polygonal tools like extrude and the swift loop tool for adding resolution, Spline modeling techniques to create smooth surfaces, and many other tools and techniques as well. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll take a look at using a smoothing or subdivision workflow and use modifiers to help shape our models.\n\nWeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re going to take a slightly different approach to this introductory training, in that we're not going to talk about all of 3ds MaxÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s modeling tools, but rather focus on the tools that you're going to find most useful as you begin the modeling process.\n\nIf you have questions on a specific tool, try doing a search and you're sure to find a lesson on it. Once you have a better understanding of how these tools work together, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be able to create your own modeling solutions and really come up with a workflow thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s comfortable for you.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:153fde5d085f8a042a9b22ab34baa7ce9f8a3ba8","amp;dn":"Digital-Tutors+-+Introduction+to+Modeling+in+3ds+Max","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"153fde5d085f8a042a9b22ab34baa7ce9f8a3ba8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,63,222,93,8,95,138,4,42,155,34,171,52,186,167,206,159,138,59,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
