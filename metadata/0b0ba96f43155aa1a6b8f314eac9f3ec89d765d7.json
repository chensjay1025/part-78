However, the video is still very watchable and should be enjoyable for any rail fans out there.  Plus, it's a bit nostalgic to be watching something on VHS don't you think?\n\nNote: There are 3 points in this file where about 1 or 2 seconds of video is skipped over.  This is due to unavoidable capture errors, but these small skips do not hinder the viewing experience in any significant way.\n\nPlease help do your part in keeping this torrent alive by seeding!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b0ba96f43155aa1a6b8f314eac9f3ec89d765d7","amp;dn":"Illinois+Terminal%3A+A+Traction+Time+Machine","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b0ba96f43155aa1a6b8f314eac9f3ec89d765d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,11,169,111,67,21,90,161,166,184,243,20,234,201,243,236,137,215,101,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
