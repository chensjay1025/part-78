The program is designed for monitoring the availability of hosts connected to the LAN or Internet (computers, servers, routers, switches), and alerting administrators in case of failures.\n\nPingMaster Pro stays hidden in the background and performs automatic checks controlling the state of the network and states of all devices connected to it. The program sends ICMP queries across the network or over the Internet and measures average response time it gets. If a certain device or a web server is unavailable, the program instantly displays a warning message to a system administrator. If a device or a server doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t accept ICMP queries, PingMaster Pro can perform SNMP monitoring or request an HTTP header to measure response time.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4db1c0e0b2043ae56bbcbb6288ea10bada7bd858","amp;dn":"AgataSoft+PingMaster+Pro+1.9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4db1c0e0b2043ae56bbcbb6288ea10bada7bd858","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,177,192,224,178,4,58,229,107,188,187,98,136,234,16,186,218,123,216,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
