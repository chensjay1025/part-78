(Portable Version)\n\nNo need to install it!\n\nThis is just the final WinRAR 3.9.1.1 Unplugged Version already registered. Plus, added the .sfx modules that were missing in the original Setup and the new v3.91 Patched files to be able to modify Locked Archives too.\n\n\nWinRAR Unplugged is portable! Now you can take the best compression tool with \n      you wherever you go, giving you extra mobility and productivity!  \n\n WinRAR Unplugged is designed to work without installation from devices like \n                 USB/Flash drives, external harddrives etc.  \n\n                       Here's what that means for you:  \n\nUse WinRAR anywhere - When you place WinRAR on an external device, you can use \n it (including your profiles, AV-Code, themes, etc.) anywhere a Windows PC is \n                                 available.  \n\nComplete storage and backup solution - Do you like to have your personal data \n   with you on an external device when travelling? Now you can take WinRAR \n  Unplugged with you on your external drives. With WinRAR unplugged you can \n            manage your data just like at home - anywhere you go!  \n\n\n Safe and secure - When you remove the device with WinRAR Unplugged, all your \n                  information is secure and leaves with you.\n\n\n\nMore infos at:\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.win-rar.com/unpluggedinfo.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.win-rar.com/unpluggedinfo.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nThe Portable SFX EXE file is built up using WinRAR. You can use it to extract the files and check them one by one if you want to be sure of what is running on your machine.\n\n\nThis has also been built up on an XP x86 machine, I don't know if this program can run on a x64 or Vista machine. I't's up to you to check it if you are using them.\n\n\n\nSUGGESTIONS ON USING P2P DOWNLOADS\n==================================\n\n1) It's always better to run all downloaded programs using Sandboxie or a similar virtual machine until you are sure they are clean.\n\n\n2) When in doubt, scan them with an Internet Scan service as the ones provided by Jotti and VirusTotal\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://virusscan.jotti.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://virusscan.jotti.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.virustotal.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.virustotal.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThis will ***NOT*** give you any warranty that a file passing their analysis is clean, nor that if they see them as a troian it's so or not just another false positive, but helps you to decide and at least ask for help or infos.\n\n\n3) Remember, trust nobody, and when in doubt, go to point 1) \n\n\n4) If you find any upload containing trojans or whatsoever malicious or unclean, instead of start cursing in the comments of the upload, take the time to go to the Suprbay Forum at:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nand report links and comments there, and someone will take care of all the nasties.\n\n\nThat's the only way to keep TPB and its uploads fresh and clean.\n\n\nThat's for what is regarding security. If after testing it you see that you like it and it's useful for you, show your support by buying it!\n\n\n\nEnjoy and remember to seed... :o)\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c624ac81bb458c8021a1385dad85d36e5c6e3a3","amp;dn":"WinRAR+3.9.1.1+Unplugged+Patched","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c624ac81bb458c8021a1385dad85d36e5c6e3a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,98,74,200,27,180,88,200,2,26,19,133,218,216,93,54,229,198,227,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
