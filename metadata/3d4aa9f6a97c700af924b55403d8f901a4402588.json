It all revolves around a mysterious bag, its contents too valuable not to attract a number of reckless gangsters. The bag though is kept safe behind a door with a codelock   its combination as much a mystery as the identity of the man that becomes the central figure in this tale of money, crime and love: Malcolm Bricks (Lee Collin Baxter), an alleged gangster.\n\nMalcolm awakes in the bunker without any memory of what just happened. Malcolm finds three dead bodies and finds himself confronted with his best friend, Trent Richards (Paul Glaser), dying and blaming him for a bloody massacre. What did he do? And what is the truth about his feelings for beautiful Jess Corman (Fiana de Guzman) who appears in the middle of this chaos? She is the sister of the only person that knows the code that will give unhindered access to room #15, the location of the bag.\n\nA cat-and-mouse game without any rules begins and is played with extreme cruelty, maliciousness and deceit. No one can be trusted. Only one thing is\ncertain: The only door to the outside world  is locked.\n\nShut   Some doors should stay closed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d4aa9f6a97c700af924b55403d8f901a4402588","amp;dn":"Shut.2009.DVDRip.XviD-VoMiT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d4aa9f6a97c700af924b55403d8f901a4402588","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,74,169,246,169,124,112,10,249,36,181,84,3,216,249,1,164,64,37,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
