Nick (Raymond Burr), is a deported gang boss who needs to get back to the United States to run his operation. Dan Miller (Robert Mitchum) is a hard-up guy, who is persuaded, both by a series of beatings and a substantial sum of money, to sell his identity to Nick. Lenore (Jane Russell) a singer, poses as a heiress, trying to marry a millionaire. They all meet up in a resort in Mexico where Nick intends to have plastic surgery to alter his looks. There, a number of double-crosses, shootings, and chases all culminate in an exciting confrontation aboard ship. His Kind of Woman, a Howard Hughes production designed to be a showcase for Jane Russell, is entertaining when viewed as a comedy. As a serious film-noir thriller, it lacks suspense and depth. However, the film has its moments, and Robert Mitchum is in his element as the loner anti-hero. \n\n   General\n      Complete name : His Kind Of Woman (1951).avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 1.48 GiB\n      Duration : 2h 0mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 762 Kbps\n      Writing application : MEncoder dev-CVS-060307-04:23-4.0.1\n      Writing library : MPlayer\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : Simple@L1\n      Format settings, BVOP : No\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (H.263)\n      Codec ID : DIVX\n      Codec ID/Info : Project Mayo\n      Codec ID/Hint : DivX 4\n      Duration : 2h 0mn\n      Bit rate : 1 621 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 480 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 4:3\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.220\n      Stream size : 1.36 GiB (92%)\n      Writing library : Lavc51.7.0\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : MPEG Audio\n      Format version : Version 1\n      Format profile : Layer 3\n      Codec ID : 55\n      Codec ID/Hint : MP3\n      Duration : 2h 0mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 128 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      Stream size : 110 MiB (7%)\n      Alignment : Aligned on interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 24 ms (0.58 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 504 ms\n      Writing library : LAME3.98 (alpha)\u0001D\u0001q\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0043643/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0043643/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnglish audio; English, French, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\nJohn Farrow - His Kind of Woman (1951)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae7e4545dcaf9b1b88685ace22978dcae6fb0a6a","amp;dn":"John+Farrow+-+His+Kind+of+Woman+%281951%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae7e4545dcaf9b1b88685ace22978dcae6fb0a6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,126,69,69,220,175,155,27,136,104,90,206,34,151,141,202,230,251,10,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
