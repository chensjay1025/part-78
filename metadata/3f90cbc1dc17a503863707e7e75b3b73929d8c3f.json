He begins with his life in Virginia Beach as a happily married police officer who plays the organ at church, has sex every night with his wife (Leslie Mann) and spends his off hours searching for his biological mother who gave him up as a child. But after a violent car crash, Russell leaves his life and family behind to go out into the world and be his true self, which is a gay man. He moves to Miami, finds a boyfriend (Rodrigo Santoro) and begins living a luxurious gay lifestyle. He realizes quickly though, that a life of luxury is expensive, leading this resourceful former cop to turn to a life as a conman. But when his con work finally catches up with him, Russell is sent to prison where he meets, and almost instantly falls in love with Phillip Morris (Ewan McGregor). From there it becomes a story of a forlorn lover who cannot bear to be separated from his soul-mate. He will go to any lengths to be with Phillip, including but not limited to walking out of jail pretending to be a doctor, after stealing a badge and painting his clothing, ordering his release pretending to be a judge, impersonating Morris's lawyer and fraudulently becoming the CFO of a major corporation. He also simulates suffering from AIDS, and forges records to indicate that he died from it. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1045772/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1045772/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPLEASE SEED AND ENJOY THANKS\n\nscreen shots\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img138.imageshack.us/img138/3554/vlcsnap00002m.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img138.imageshack.us/img138/3554/vlcsnap00002m.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img339.imageshack.us/img339/7499/vlcsnap00003v.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img339.imageshack.us/img339/7499/vlcsnap00003v.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img63.imageshack.us/img63/2944/vlcsnap00007n.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img63.imageshack.us/img63/2944/vlcsnap00007n.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img697.imageshack.us/img697/3608/vlcsnap00017r.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img697.imageshack.us/img697/3608/vlcsnap00017r.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMy Other Torrents &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/vicerock/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/vicerock/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f90cbc1dc17a503863707e7e75b3b73929d8c3f","amp;dn":"I.Love.You.Phillip.Morris.DvDRip.XviD...vice","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f90cbc1dc17a503863707e7e75b3b73929d8c3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,144,203,193,220,23,165,3,134,55,7,231,231,91,59,115,146,157,140,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
