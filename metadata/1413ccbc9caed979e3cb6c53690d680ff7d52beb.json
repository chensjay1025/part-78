He looked at the greed of the financial industry in the Hollywood hit Wall Street and its forthcoming sequel. In South of the Border, his latest documentary out this week in the United States, Stone takes a road trip across South America, meeting with seven presidents about the revolution sweeping the continent. The leftist transformation in the region might be ignored or misrepresented as nothing but &quot;anti-Americanism&quot; in the corporate media, but this film seeks to tell a different story. Stone joins us along with the filmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s co-writer, the Pakistani British author and activist Tariq Ali.
