Oh that great piece on album so and so. Great music but you never play it. Its too long for the audience and such a hustle when you are alone. Same with me.\n\nSo I thought lets list these pieces and see whether I could play them in some quite moments when you have the time to listen to music. Not 3 or 4 minutes but real Rock Symphony`s greater than 7 minutes (Brother in Arms is exactly 7 minutes).\n\nSo I made five 2-hour playlists (A148-152) and now I play these wonderful compositions once in while (nice). If anyone has some suggestions for monumental Rock Projects I missed?. For some good candidates, like Valentyn Suite and Supper's Ready (Genesis), I could not find a proper recording. Please put them on the net if you have one of these.... Enjoy,\n\nPS: I skipped a few good tracks like Bohemian Rhapsody and Stairway to Heaven (too well known).\n\n\nA148 Fool's Overture (Symphonic Rock)\n\n01 Pink Floyd - Atom Heart Mother\n02 Supertramp - Fool's Overture\n03 Porcupine Tree - Anesthetize\n04 Pink Floyd - Shine On You Crazy Diamond (Part I-V)\n05 Riverside - Deprived (Irretrievably Lost Imagination)\n06 Joe Jackson - Zemeo\n07 Steven Wilson - The Watchmaker\n08 Dream Theater - Octavarium\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24fd3396b52889ec130c72d20ea5656439a354df","amp;dn":"VA+Rock+Symphony%60s+-+Fool%27s+Overture+%28Dutch+Treat+%5EA148+VBR%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24fd3396b52889ec130c72d20ea5656439a354df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,253,51,150,181,40,137,236,19,12,114,210,14,165,101,100,57,163,84,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
