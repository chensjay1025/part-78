Gearing up to unleash a new album 'The Dreams of Kids' on Altercation Records in 2010, Born To Lose are determined to win the world over, one fan at a time. Having toured with everyone from the Street Dogs, Horrorpops, U.S. Bombs, Far From Finished and the Ducky Boys, headlining clubs in Europe, appearing on the 2009 Vans Warped Tour and performing on the Old Skars + Upstarts Tour alongside Duane Peters and Anti-Nowhere League, Born To Lose seem unstoppable. &quot;'Saints Gone Wrong' is a ticking time bomb of an album set to explode with the same fiery intensity that has shot bands like the Street Dogs and Dropkick into the public spotlight.&quot; - Punknews.org &quot;Born To Lose have become one of the most legendary working class street punk outfits in recent memory.&quot; - Amp Magazine\n\n01.
