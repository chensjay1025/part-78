Life on Poplar Street seems idyllic at the start of this particular midsummer day: neighbors tossing frisbees, washing cars, and lighting barbecues. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s something amiss in the house where autistic eight-year-old Seth lives, howeverÃ¢â‚¬â€an intangible Ã¢â‚¬Å“somethingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that will eventually warp the entire neighborhoodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s concept of reality. Before the sun sets on this surrealistic summer day, the quiet Ohio suburb will become a terrifying slaughterhouse. The most stalwart of horror fans will be hard pressed not to flinch as this gruesome tale unfolds. Thanks to the talent of master narrator Frank Muller, each unexpected terror will send another tingle up and down the readerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s spine.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ab001a1650b771581ffa682364da32607ed95da","amp;dn":"Stephen+King-The+Regulators","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ab001a1650b771581ffa682364da32607ed95da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,176,1,161,101,11,119,21,129,255,166,130,54,77,163,38,7,237,149,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
