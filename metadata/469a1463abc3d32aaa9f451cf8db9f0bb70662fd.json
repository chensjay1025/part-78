They later realise these power failures are caused by the radiation of a binary neutron star and Destiny is diverting all power to the shields to compensate. Young decides to surrender control of the ship while sending Rush to hide and regain control from one of the other panels aided by Telford. When Kiva and Telford shoot each other the new leader of the Lucian Alliance decides this must be a plot and separates the civilians from the military personnel to &quot;put an end to this&quot;. All military personnel are about to be executed when the next burst hits the ship.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:469a1463abc3d32aaa9f451cf8db9f0bb70662fd","amp;dn":"SGU+S01E20+Incursion+part+2+DivXNL-team+NL-subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"469a1463abc3d32aaa9f451cf8db9f0bb70662fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,154,20,99,171,195,211,42,170,159,69,28,248,219,159,11,183,6,98,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
