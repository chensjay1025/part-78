Wow! This is a great movie.\nI've seen other comedies this year but this by far has to be the funniest! Hilarity abounds at this funeral. It's a great time to be had by all. Laughs galore! \nParents beware. There is a good reason for the R Rating. There are a few gags to that are not suitable for children: There are the gross out poop gags having to do with the character of Uncle Russell and some total-male-nudity gags that occur when one character gets high on dope. \nBut aside from that it's 90% good-natured humor that comes from incidents that are described in other reviews.\nWhat happens to Danny Glover's character (Uncle Russell) at the end you've just got to see!\n\nRelease Date: 16 April 2010 (USA)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f289b8ee8d452fd4c426c35a448eecc9c3dc261","amp;dn":"Death+at+a+Funeral+%28Movie+Trailer%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f289b8ee8d452fd4c426c35a448eecc9c3dc261","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,40,155,142,232,212,82,253,76,66,108,53,164,72,238,204,156,61,194,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
