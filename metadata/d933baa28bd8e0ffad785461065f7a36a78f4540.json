Johnson. Although the inconsistency of the approach precluded a musical statement along the lines of Superfly, it's an interesting find for those looking for little-heeded early-'70s soul with funk and rock influences. \nWomack's cuts count among his better material, and even if the title track cops much of its attitude from Superfly, it has a satisfyingly tough soul-rock groove of its own. &quot;If You Want My Love&quot; is a good grainy ballad, &quot;Quicksand&quot; a propulsive number well-suited for action scenes, and &quot;Do It Right&quot; in the mold of James Brown, but more rock-oriented. \nJohnson's instrumental contributions, while not as interesting, set a nice period soul-jazz mood, and there are nifty periodic washes of electronic effects in both composers' contributions.
